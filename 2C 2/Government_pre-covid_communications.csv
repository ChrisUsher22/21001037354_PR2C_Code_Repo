PRE-COVID,Prime Minister's New Year's message: 31 December 2019,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-ministers-new-years-message-31-december-2019,Prime Minister,31 December 2019,"That distinctive sound you may have heard at midnight as the bongs of Big Ben faded away was not the popping of champagne corks or the crackle of fireworks from your neighbour’s garden.

Rather it was the starting gun being fired on what promises to be a fantastic year and a remarkable decade for our United Kingdom.

As we say goodbye to 2019 we can also turn the page on the division, rancour and uncertainty which has dominated public life and held us back for far too long. We can start a new chapter in the history of our country, in which we come together and move forward united, unleashing the enormous potential of the British people.

Of course the first item on my agenda is to fulfil the will of the electorate and take us out of the European Union. This should have happened already, but we were thwarted by a Parliament determined to use every trick in the book to stop us leaving the EU.

Now we have a new Parliament, elected by the people to deliver the people’s priorities, which will finally respect the referendum and deliver Brexit.

So we’ll get Brexit done before the end of this month. That oven-ready deal I talked about so much during the election campaign has already had its plastic covering pierced and been placed in the microwave.

We got down to work immediately after the election. The necessary legislation has already begun its passage through Parliament and, once MPs return to Westminster, we’ll waste no time in finishing the job. At long last we will take back control of our laws, borders, money and trade.

Then we can finally spend 2020 getting on with delivering on the people’s priorities: boosting the NHS with the biggest cash injection in its history, renewing schools, backing scientists, building better infrastructure, controlling immigration, making our streets safer, cleaning up our environment, and making our Union stronger.

The loudest message I heard during the election campaign is that people expect us – expect me – to protect and improve the NHS. The NHS is a wonderful British invention, there for us and our families when we are ill, whatever our background and regardless of ability to pay.

So the NHS will always be my top priority. One our first actions will be to pass a bill enshrining in law a record funding settlement for the NHS, providing an extra £34 billion a year. We will undertake the largest hospital building programme in living memory, delivering 40 new hospitals and 20 upgrades. We’ll ensure there are 50,000 more nurses, 6,000 more GPs, and 50 million more GP surgery appointments.

I also want to make this country the best place on earth when it comes to quality education and cutting-edge science. It’s great that we have started to climb back up the international school league tables – now let’s make it to the very top. We will support hardworking teachers by boosting per pupil funding in primary and secondary schools and we will transform this country’s approach to science and research, making the UK an engine for the ideas of the future.

Our vision is clear: to unite and level up across the whole United Kingdom – spreading opportunity more fairly – with better infrastructure, superb education and high technology.

We will do all of this while keeping your taxes low, freezing rates of income tax, VAT and National Insurance.

It is thanks to you, the people, that we are on the path to a brighter future. It was your decisiveness at the ballot box, your determination to drive an electoral bulldozer through the deadlock and paralysis, that has unblocked parliament and delivered a people’s government dedicated to serving you.

I know that many of you do not consider yourself natural Tories and may only have lent me your vote. I am humbled by your support and will work every day to keep it. I am also acutely aware that there are millions of people who did not vote for me and were disappointed by the result.

If you are one of them, I want to reassure you that I will be a Prime Minister for everyone, not just those who voted for me. I know that you love this country no less, simply because you voted for another party or wanted to Remain. More than that, I want to work with you, as friends and equals, as we build the future this United Kingdom deserves.

So let’s together make the 2020s a decade of prosperity and opportunity. State of the art healthcare. Great schools in every community. Our cities and towns more connected than ever before – not just in London and the South East but in the Midlands, the North and across the country. New trading relationships with nations around the world, generating jobs and growth. British scientists and engineers transforming the way we live – curing incurable diseases and making transport cleaner, greener and quieter.

It’s a fantastically exciting agenda. Let’s get to work."
PRE-COVID,Prime Minister pledges new action to eliminate homelessness and rough sleeping,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-minister-pledges-new-action-to-eliminate-homelessness-and-rough-sleeping,Prime Minister,23 December 2019,"Thousands of people will be prevented from falling into homelessness and sleeping rough on the streets thanks to millions of funding announced by the Prime Minister today (23 December 2019).

As part of his drive to tackle homelessness, over £260 million has been committed for local authorities to support people who are homeless or at risk of losing their homes.

The funding will empower councils across England to provide the best services for local needs, helping those experiencing homelessness in their area to improve their lives and get back on their feet.

Councils can use the funding to employ specialists to provide practical advice to vulnerable people to help ensure they are meeting their rent payments, as well as helping them to find long-term stable accommodation.

Visiting a rough sleeping shelter in London, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said:

It cannot be right in the 21st century that people are homeless or having to sleep on our streets, and this government will work tirelessly to bring this to an end.

This new funding is going to help councils provide better support to homeless people, and importantly, prevent people from becoming homeless in the first place.

But we have got to do even more, and we’re committed to expanding rough sleeping and homelessness programmes, and ensuring more integrated working between our local health and housing services.

I salute the Standard for their campaign on homelessness in London, particularly their vital work in supporting vulnerable women across the capital.

The Prime Minister has also confirmed the Cold Weather Fund will receive an additional £3 million, taking the total to £13 million, to enhance support available for rough sleepers during the winter period.

This new action forms part of a wider strategy to tackle all forms of homelessness. The government is already investing £1.2 billon to tackle homelessness, and last year introduced ambitious new legislation, the Homelessness Reduction Act to ensure people at risk of becoming homeless get help more quickly, with councils receiving funding to support them in these duties.

Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick MP said:

As Communities Secretary, it’s one of my main priorities to ensure that we reduce all forms of homelessness and rough sleeping.

That’s why we have announced an additional £260 million funding in homelessness funding – to ensure councils up and down the country provide crucial services tailored to their areas.

Last year the number of people sleeping rough fell for the first time in several years, and while the government’s interventions are working, there is a great deal more work to do. We’re committed to eliminating rough sleeping by the end of the Parliament.

Of the money announced today, the first £200 million comes from the Flexible Homelessness Support Grant, introduced in 2017, to lead to a radical change in the way councils were providing support to those at risk of homelessness.

The remaining funding, the £63 million Homelessness Reduction Grant, will go to councils to fulfil their duties under the Homelessness Reduction Act, which came into force last year, to help homeless households into accommodation.

The Act requires public bodies, such as hospitals, prisons and social services, to refer people who may be threatened with homelessness to a housing authority."
PRE-COVID,"PM's speech to British troops in Tapa, Estonia: 21 December 2019",https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pms-speech-to-british-troops-in-tapa-estonia-21-december-2019--2,Prime Minister,21 December 2019,"My mission is very simple, it is to say thank you. Because of course in the next few days everybody in our country is going to spend Christmas with their families, and you are going to be here. A long way away, in a pretty cold place, at Christmas, in the Baltic States in Estonia.

And what you are doing is incredibly important because the reason everybody in our country can have Christmas in peace and security is because of what you are doing here.

Quite literally what you are doing is showing that NATO works, and that NATO is an alliance to which we in this country are absolutely committed.

And the idea of NATO is very, very simple. It’s all for one and one for all. And that means that when our Estonian friends want a commitment by the British Army we make that commitment with this Enhanced Forward Presence.

And they love it. It does fantastic things for the local community and I talked earlier on to Prime Minister Jüri Ratas and he says that the contribution of British troops is fantastic and all the engagement with the local population is wonderful.

But it’s about much more than that. It’s a demonstration by our country that we are committed to the security and stability of the whole of Europe, and you are the most vivid and powerful possible symbol and expression of that support and commitment.

And that is why one billion people are protected by the NATO alliance. The most successful military alliance in history.

And that is why we have peace and security and stability in Europe, and peace and stability in Europe for seventy years.

And it is an incredible thing for me to come to Estonia and think that when I was a kid, when I was your age actually, Estonia was part of the Soviet Union and we are now here helping to protect Estonia and to guarantee its security.

It is a fantastic thing, it is a deeply moving thing for someone of my generation.

Thank you all very much for what you are doing. Happy Christmas.

PRE-COVID,Queen's Speech December 2019,https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/queens-speech-december-2019,HM Queen,19 December 2019,"My Lords and Members of the House of Commons.

My Government’s priority is to deliver the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union on 31 January. My Ministers will bring forward legislation to ensure the United Kingdom’s exit on that date and to make the most of the opportunities that this brings for all the people of the United Kingdom.

Thereafter, my Ministers will seek a future relationship with the European Union based on a free trade agreement that benefits the whole of the United Kingdom. They will also begin trade negotiations with other leading global economies.

The integrity and prosperity of the United Kingdom is of the utmost importance to my Government. My Ministers will work urgently to facilitate talks to restore devolved Government in Northern Ireland.

My Government will embark on an ambitious programme of domestic reform that delivers on the people’s priorities. For the first time, the National Health Service’s multi-year funding settlement, agreed earlier this year, will be enshrined in law.

Steps will be taken to grow and support the National Health Service’s workforce and a new visa will ensure qualified doctors, nurses and health professionals have fast-track entry to the United Kingdom. Hospital car parking charges will be removed for those in greatest need.

My Ministers will seek cross-party consensus on proposals for long term reform of social care. They will ensure that the social care system provides everyone with the dignity and security they deserve and that no one who needs care has to sell their home to pay for it. My ministers will continue work to reform the Mental Health Act.

A modern, fair, points-based immigration system will welcome skilled workers from across the world to contribute to the United Kingdom’s economy, communities and public services.

My Government will bring forward measures to support working families, raising the National Insurance threshold and increasing the National Living Wage. To ensure every child has access to a high-quality education my Ministers will increase levels of funding per pupil in every school.

Measures will be brought forward to encourage flexible working, to introduce the entitlement to leave for unpaid carers and to help people save for later life. New measures will be brought forward to protect tenants and to improve building safety. My Government will take steps to support home ownership, including by making homes available at a discount for local first-time buyers. My Ministers will develop legislation to improve internet safety for all.

My Government is committed to a fair justice system that keeps people safe. My ministers will establish a Royal Commission to review and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the criminal justice process. New sentencing laws will ensure the most serious violent offenders, including terrorists, serve longer in custody. New laws will require schools, police, councils and health authorities to work together to prevent serious crime. My Government will ensure those charged with knife possession face swift justice and that the courts work better for all those who engage with them, including victims of domestic abuse. Legislation will be brought forward to support victims of crime and their families. Measures will be developed to tackle hostile activity conducted by foreign states.

My Ministers will bring forward measures to ensure that every part of the United Kingdom can prosper. My Government will invest in the country’s public services and infrastructure whilst keeping borrowing and debt under control; maintaining the sustainability of the public finances through a responsible fiscal strategy. My Government will prioritise investment in infrastructure and world-leading science research and skills, in order to unleash productivity and improve daily life for communities across the country. It will give communities more control over how investment is spent so that they can decide what is best for them.

To support business, my government will increase tax credits for research and development, establish a National Skills Fund, and bring forward changes to business rates. New laws will accelerate the delivery of gigabit capable broadband. To ensure people can depend on the transport network, measures will be developed to provide for minimum levels of service during transport strikes.

My Government will continue to take steps to meet the world-leading target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. It will continue to lead the way in tackling global climate change, hosting the COP26 Summit in 2020. To protect and improve the environment for future generations, a bill will enshrine in law environmental principles and legally-binding targets, including for air quality. It will also ban the export of polluting plastic waste to countries outside the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and establish a new, world-leading independent regulator in statute.

A Constitution, Democracy and Rights Commission will be established. Work will be taken forward to repeal the Fixed-term Parliaments Act.

My Government will continue to invest in our gallant Armed Forces. My Government will honour the Armed Forces Covenant, which will be further incorporated into law, and the NATO commitment to spend at least two per cent of national income on defence. It will bring forward proposals to tackle vexatious claims that undermine our Armed Forces and will continue to seek better ways of dealing with legacy issues that provide better outcomes for victims and survivors.

My Government will work to promote and expand the United Kingdom’s influence in the world. An Integrated Security, Defence and Foreign Policy Review will be undertaken to reassess the nation’s place in the world, covering all aspects of international policy from defence to diplomacy and development. My Ministers will promote the United Kingdom’s interests, including freedom of speech, human rights and the rule of law. My Government will work closely with international partners to help solve the most complex international security issues and promote peace and security globally. It will stand firm against those who threaten the values of the United Kingdom, including by developing a sanctions regime to directly address human rights abuse, and working to ensure that all girls have access to twelve years of quality education.

Members of the House of Commons

Estimates for the public services will be laid before you.

My Lords and Members of the House of Commons

Other measures will be laid before you.

I pray that the blessing of Almighty God may rest upon your counsels."
PRE-COVID,PM statement in Downing Street: 13 December 2019,https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-in-downing-street-13-december-2019,Prime Minister,13 December 2019,"This morning I went to Buckingham Palace and I am forming a new government

and on Monday MPs will arrive at Westminster to form a new parliament and I am proud to say that

members of our new one nation government – a people’s government – will set out from constituencies that have never returned a Conservative MP for 100 years

and yes they will have an overwhelming mandate, from this election, to get Brexit done

and we will honour that mandate by Jan 31

and so in this moment of national resolution I want to speak directly to those who made it possible

and to all those who voted for us, for the first time,

all those whose pencils may have wavered over the ballot

and who heard the voices of their parents and their grandparents whispering anxiously in their ears

I say thank you for the trust you have placed in us and in me

and we will work round the clock to repay your trust and to deliver on your priorities

with a parliament that works for you

and then I want to speak also to those who did not vote for us or for me

and who wanted and perhaps still want to remain in the EU

and I want you to know that we in this one nation conservative government will never ignore

your good and positive feelings – of warmth and sympathy towards the other nations of Europe

because now is the moment – precisely as we leave the EU – to let those natural feelings find renewed expression

in building a new partnership, which is one of the great projects for next year

and as we work together with the EU

as friends and sovereign equals

in tackling climate change and terrorism

in building academic and scientific cooperation, redoubling our trading relationship

I frankly urge everyone on either side of what after three and a half years after all an increasingly arid argument I urge everyone to find closure and to let the healing begin

because I believe, in fact I know, because I have heard it loud and clear from every corner of the country that the overwhelming priority of the British people now is that we should focus above all on the NHS

that simple and beautiful idea that represents the best of our country with the biggest ever cash boost

50,000 more nurses, 40 new hospitals as well as providing better schools, safer streets

and in the next few weeks and months we will be bringing forward proposals to transform this country

with better infrastructure, better education, better technology

and if you ask yourselves what is this new government going to do, what is he going to do with his extraordinary majority

I will tell you that is what we are going to do we are going to unite and level up – unite and level up

bringing together the whole of this incredible United Kingdom

England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland together

taking us forward unleashing the potential of the whole country delivering opportunity across the entire nation

and since I know that after five weeks frankly of electioneering this country deserves a break from

wrangling, a break from politics, and a permanent break from talking about Brexit

I want everyone to go about their Christmas preparations happy and secure in the knowledge that here in this people’s government the work is now being stepped up

to make 2020 a year of prosperity and growth and hope and to deliver a Parliament that works for the people

thank you all very much and happy Christmas."
PRE-COVID,PM statement at NATO meeting: 4 December 2019,https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-at-nato-meeting-4-december-2019,Prime Minister,4 December 2019,"It was agreed amongst all of us that 70 years after its foundation here in London, it is absolutely true to say that NATO is the most successful alliance in history and it now guarantees the peace and prosperity of a billion people around the world in 29 countries. It will shortly be 30 of course, now that North Macedonia is joining.

And everybody also attested to the fundamental reason for the success of that alliance and it is based on the idea of solidarity, in defence of our values of freedom and democracy, the basic idea of all for one and one for all encapsulated in Article 5 of the North Atlantic treaty that we come to each other’s mutual defence.

That’s why NATO works and that’s why it’s so powerful and so successful.

And of course the UK has long argued that you can’t be complacent about that, you can’t remotely take that for granted, you’ve got to ensure that we continue to spend on our collective defence and that’s why we’ve made the case for 2% of GDP as the minimum NATO spend for every member.

And we’ve been successful in that campaign, because if you look at what’s happened since the Cardiff summit in 2014, actually there has been a substantial increase in spending by our European friends of $130 billion dollars - it will rise to $400 billion by 2024.

And at this meeting here today and country after country pledged or gave an account of how they were going to meet the pledge of 2%.

I was able to sketch out some of the ways which the UK leads in for instance the European contribution to the NATO readiness initiative and we are contributing one armed brigade, two squadrons of fast jets, six major warships - including the two aircraft carriers.

And several other delegations, several other nations, also emphasised that were going to step up their contributions to the readiness initiative amongst other things.

And there was a mood of very great solidarity and determination and a willingness to push NATO forward, not just for the next few years but for the next 70 years.

A real belief in the long-standing value of this alliance.

And we also had good discussions on Russia, how we should respond collectively to Russia, the need to be aware of Russia but also the need to engage.

We discussed cyber, the challenges of what is going on in cyberspace, the asymmetric warfare and threats that we collectively face, the need for us to engage together in looking at the challenges from space and working together to develop a policy on space.

We also agreed that we would, having heard a really terrible account of the earthquake in Tirana in Albania from Edi Rama, we also agreed that we would act collectively to help the people of Tirana and Durres to get back on their feet.

And that was the essence of the discussion that I think was extremely practical and extremely harmonious."
PRE-COVID,PM opening words at North Atlantic Council: 4 December 2019,https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-opening-words-at-north-atlantic-council-4-december-2019,Prime Minister,4 December 2019,"I’m delighted to welcome everybody here to the UK to celebrate the 70th anniversary of NATO.

I feel as if our alliance is coming home because Britain was a founding member and it was here that NATO opened its first headquarters – of course in Belgrave Square in London shortly before moving to Paris, as colleagues will recall.

Seventy years on, we are rock solid in our commitment to NATO and to the giant shield of solidarity that now protects 29 countries and nearly a billion people.

The fact that we live in peace today demonstrates the power of the simple proposition at the heart of this alliance: that for as long as we stand together, no-one could hope to defeat us - and therefore no-one will start a war.

This essential principle is enshrined in Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty: that if any one of us is attacked, all of us will go to their defence.

If NATO has a motto, it is as Jens says, one for all, and all for one.

This doctrine of coming to one another’s aid, incarnated by NATO, provides the single most important explanation for why the British people and hundreds of millions of our friends live in peace and freedom today.

Everything our peoples hold dear – from liberty and democracy to their jobs, homes, schools and hospitals – would not be secure and could not flourish without the peace that NATO is designed to guarantee.

But history shows that peace cannot be taken for granted and even as we celebrate this anniversary, we must ensure that our deeds match our words and the atrocity in London last Friday shows why we must work together to combat terrorism and the vital importance of NATO’s missions to counter this threat.

For the UK’s part, we spend over 2% of GDP on defence.

We are proudly making the biggest contribution of any European ally to NATO’s Readiness Initiative by offering an armoured brigade, two fighter squadrons and six warships, including the Royal Navy’s new aircraft carriers.

As friends and allies, we must never shy away from discussing new realities, particularly NATO’s response to emerging threats like hybrid warfare and disruptive technologies including space and cyber.

At this Council, we have the opportunity to strengthen the unity of purpose that has made NATO the greatest and most successful alliance in history and to take the new steps that are profoundly necessary to ensure another 70 years of peace and security.

PRE-COVID,PM's statement on the Grenfell Phase One report: 30 October 2019,https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pms-statement-on-the-grenfell-phase-one-report-30-october-2019,Prime Minister,30 October 2019,"Before I begin, let me say I will be making quite a lengthy speech this afternoon, reflecting the very comprehensive nature of the report.

So if Hon and Rt Hon members bear with me I am sure that I will address whatever issues they may be planning to intervene on.

Mr Speaker, the bereaved, the survivors, and the members of the north Kensington community joining us in the galleries today each have their own story to tell, their own perspective on what happened at Grenfell.

But, over the past two-and-a-half years, they have been united in their fight to uncover the truth.

It is not a fight they would ever have chosen.

But it is one that they have taken up with determination, with dedication, and with great dignity.

Yet their exceptional tenacity in seeking justice has not always been matched by their faith in the system’s ability to deliver.

This is no surprise.

After all, they have been let down many times before.

Too often overlooked and ignored in the months and years before the tragedy.

And, shamefully, failed by the institutions that were supposed to serve them in the days and weeks after it.

Since then the survivors, the bereaved and the local community have endured one unbearable milestone after another.

The funerals.

The anniversaries.

Giving and hearing evidence at the public inquiry.

The painful process of building a new life in a new home without loved ones and without treasured possessions.

And then the publication of this report today.

And all this while carrying with them the unimaginable trauma suffered that night.

I am very much aware that no report, no words, no apology will ever make good the loss suffered and the trauma experienced.

But I hope that the findings being published today, and the debate we are holding this afternoon, will bring some measure of comfort to those who suffered so much.

They asked for the truth.

We promised them the truth.

We owe them the truth.

And, today, the whole country, the whole world, is finally hearing the truth about what happened at Grenfell Tower on the 14th of June 2017.

When the sun rose over London that morning, it revealed an ugly scar of black smoke cutting across an otherwise clear blue summer sky – and, on the streets of north Kensington, a scene of horror and desperation.

Shortly before one o’clock that morning a faulty fridge-freezer had started a small fire in the kitchen of a flat on the fourth floor of the 24-storey Grenfell Tower.

The resident of that flat did everything right.

He raised the alarm, called the fire brigade, alerted his neighbours.

Within five minutes firefighters arrived to deal with what appeared to be a routine incident.

And in the normal course of events, the fire would have been contained, extinguished, and that would have been that.

But what happened that night was anything but normal.

And so, even before firefighters began to tackle the blaze on the inside of the tower, unbeknown to them flames were already beginning to race up the outside.

Just seven minutes after the first firefighters entered the kitchen on the fourth floor, a resident on the 22nd dialled 999 to report the blaze at her level, almost 200 feet higher up.

By 1:27am a column of fire had reached the roof. One whole side of the building was ablaze.

Dense smoke and searing flames, visible across the capital, began wrapping around the tower, penetrating its heart.

And by 1:30am, less than three-quarters-of-an-hour after it began, it was clear to those watching below that the inferno was completely out of control.

Grenfell Tower – filled that night with almost 300 souls in its 129 flats – was beyond saving.

The fire that shocked the nation and the world that June morning took the lives of 72 men, women and children.

The oldest, known simply as Sheila, was a poet, artist and great-grandmother, who had brought joy to many and seen and experienced much in her 84 years.

The youngest, Logan Gomes, had never even seen his own parents – he was stillborn hours after his mother made a narrow escape from the choking, noxious smoke.

Many who lived together died together: husbands and wives, parents and children, were found in each other’s arms.

Those who survived saw everything they owned reduced to dust and ash – wedding dresses, irreplaceable photographs, beloved children’s toys, all gone.

And the true scale of the trauma – the impact of the fire not only on those who survived but those who lost loved ones or witnessed its destruction – is unlikely ever to be known.

Grenfell represented the biggest loss of life in a single incident in the UK since the Hillsborough tragedy 28 years previously.

However my predecessor as Prime Minister, the Rt Hon Member for Maidenhead, was determined that there would be no repeat of the travesty that followed that disaster – which saw the friends and families of those who died forced to fight the establishment tooth and nail, year after year, decade after decade to secure justice for their loved ones.

That is why, just 15 days after the tragedy, the then Prime Minister appointed one of our most experienced and respected former judges, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, to lead a rigorous, public and completely independent inquiry into what happened.

Sir Martin has today published his report on the first Phase of that inquiry, covering the events of 14 June.

The cause of the fire and its rapid spread, and the way in which emergency services and others handled the immediate response.

As the sponsoring Minister under the terms of the Inquiries Act 2005, I have this morning laid copies of the report before Parliament.

I was in no doubt that the House should have the opportunity to debate it on the day of publication.

Grenfell was a national tragedy – and this is a report of great national importance.

However I recognise that Sir Martin has produced a very substantial piece of work, almost a thousand pages across four volumes.

And the vast majority of Hon and Rt Hon members will not yet therefore have had the opportunity to digest and analyse it in any great detail.

I believe that Members do have an important role to play in scrutinising such reports and the government’s response to them.

So let me reassure the House that we will seek to schedule a further debate on Sir Martin’s findings at the earliest suitable opportunity so that members can debate the report in detail.

This may obviously be after the election – but we will ensure it will happen.

But of course what happened in the hours that the fire raged is only half the story.

Phase two of the inquiry, which will start taking oral evidence early in the new year, will look at the wider context.

And this will include the nature and application of building regulations, the way in which local and central government responded to the fire, and the handling of concerns raised by tenants over many years.

Phase one sets out WHAT happened; phase two will explain WHY.

And such a complex process will inevitably take time.

Longer than any of us would wish.

But, as I said, we owe it to the people of Grenfell Tower to explain, once and for all and beyond all doubt, exactly why the tragedy unfolded as it did.

And, with the standard set by this first report, I am confident that is exactly what will happen.

Sir Martin’s work is exhaustive in its detail.

He provides an authoritative and often harrowing minute-by-minute account of the fire and its terrifying spread.

Led always by the facts, his recommendations are clear and numerous.

And where there are failings to be highlighted, Sir Martin does so without fear or favour.

Nowhere is that clearer than in Sir Martin’s verdict on the single biggest cause of this tragedy.

He leaves no doubt that the cladding on the exterior of Grenfell Tower was the defining factor in the rapid and all-consuming spread of the blaze.

It was the cladding – the aluminium composite material rain screen and the combustible insulation behind it – that ignited because of the fire in flat 16.

It was the cladding that allowed the flames to climb so rapidly up the outside of the tower, causing compartmentation to fail.

And it was the cladding that turned into molten plastic, raining fire on the streets of north Kensington and causing the blaze to travel down and down the building as well as up.

In short it was the cladding that turned a routine and containable kitchen fire into a disaster of unprecedented proportions that cost 72 people their lives.

Sir Martin is clear that the cladding on Grenfell Tower was fitted in breach of building regulations.

And why this was allowed to happen – and who was responsible for it – will be covered in phase two of his inquiry.

But we cannot afford to stand by and wait for his full conclusions.

As the report says, it is essential that all similar cladding is removed as quickly as possible.

That is why the previous Government established a fund to pay for the removal of such systems from tall residential buildings.

I’m pleased to say that all such buildings owned by central and local government have now had their cladding removed, and are undergoing work to remove it or at the very least have such work scheduled.

In the private sector progress is slower.

Too many building owners have not acted responsibly.

While the people living in those privately owned buildings are safe – round-the-clock fire patrols and other temporary measures ensure that is the case – I’m in no doubt they need a long-term and lasting solution.

Nearly all private high rise residential buildings where such cladding remains are now in line to have remedial work scheduled.

Where that is not case, the government will work with local authorities to take enforcement action if landlords refuse to deal with the problems themselves.

I think the House would agree they’ve had enough time.

There are no more excuses.

Make those buildings safe or face the consequences.

The cladding on Grenfell Tower caused the fire to spread out of control and to behave in ways nobody had seen before.

And this unprecedented fire created an unprecedented challenge for the many men and women sent to fight it.

Mr Speaker, since 2017 much has been written, from many perspectives, about the way in which the London Fire Brigade handled the unfolding disaster.

So let me be very clear from the start.

After examining all the evidence and listening to hundreds of witnesses and experts, Sir Martin does not call into doubt the actions or bravery of any of the rank-and-file firefighters dispatched to Grenfell Tower.

No one or any of us in this House or the Other Place.

As mayor of this great city I saw for myself the courage and commitment demonstrated by the men and women of the London Fire Brigade.

And as Sir Martin report bears that out, telling of firefighters exhibiting and I quote “extraordinary courage and selfless devotion to duty” as they pushed themselves “to and even beyond the limits of endurance”, facing choking smoke and temperatures as high as a thousand degrees Celsius.

Their work that night was nothing short of phenomenal.

However, Sir Martin concludes that the firefighters on duty that night were “faced with a situation for which they had not been properly prepared”.

He finds that the London Fire Brigade’s planning and training for such an incident were “gravely inadequate” and that on the night of the fire there were “serious deficiencies” I quote in command and control.

The report highlights a lack of co-ordination between emergency services – what Sir Martin calls a “serious failure” of stated policies.

And I think this will be the point that will be of most concern to those who lost loved ones – he finds that the failure to order an evacuation of the tower once the fire was clearly out of control most probably led to the deaths of individuals who could otherwise have been saved.

The so-called “stay put” policy is the bedrock on which all plans for fighting fires in tall residential buildings are based.

Building regulations are supposed to mean that fires cannot spread beyond individual flats, that they are compartmented.

When that is the case, it is indeed safest for most residents to stay in their homes until the fire is extinguished.

But at Grenfell, that was the not case.

The fire spread – both widely and rapidly – up, and down and across the tower.

The inquiry found that, by 1:30am, it was clear that compartmentation had failed.

By 1:50am it was still not too late to order an evacuation.

Yet, according to Sir Martin, senior officers simply could not conceive of a situation where compartmentation could fail so comprehensively.

In the report, “stay put” is described as such an article of faith within the fire service that senior officers were reluctant to let the reality before them override their training.

And as a result, the decision to order an evacuation was not taken until 2:35am – by which time the tower’s single staircase was already filling with impenetrable smoke.

Even after this time, poor and confused lines of communication meant that operators in the 999 control room were not aware that the advice had changed.

Swamped by the sheer volume of calls and dealing with a challenge well outside their experience and training, some continued to give conflicting advice to callers trapped inside the tower.

Sir Martin notes that many operators did not realise how all-encompassing the fire had become until well after 5am, when a lull in calls allowed them to check their phones and see images of the burning building for the first time.

Information gleaned from callers inside the tower was faithfully recorded, but only rarely made its way to firefighters who could act upon it.

While brave firefighters led many people to safety from inside the tower, Sir Martin concludes the chaos and confusion meant that some calls for help were not responded to until it was too late.

Sir Martin cautions against making judgements at a distance, and I agree with him wholeheartedly

It is very easy for us, on these green benches, to have 20:20 hindsight.

And we are not about to run into the heart of a fire that is blazing more than 200 feet into the night sky.

And while I believe it is vital that individuals are held accountable for their errors, we must do so carefully.

It is clear from this report that the firefighters on the ground were in a position they should never have been in…

Doing their damnedest to tackle a fire that should never have been allowed to happen.

But that does not absolve us of responsibility.

We must ensure that the failures identified by the inquiry are corrected.

For not only does Sir Martin highlight that mistakes made by the London Fire Brigade in responding to the Lakanal House fire were repeated, he also raises concerns that the London Fire Brigade is “at risk of not learning the lessons of the Grenfell Tower fire”.

It is vital that they do so.

And I’m sure everyone at the London Fire Brigade will want to do so.

Because, as an MP, as mayor or as a journalist, I have never met a firefighter who was anything less than totally committed to public safety.

And I will be working with the London Fire Brigade, the mayor’s office, and local authorities across London to ensure the lessons of Grenfell are learned and Londoners are made safer for it.

I can confirm that, where Sir Martin recommends responsibility for fire safety be taken on by central government, we will legislate accordingly.

And, more widely, we plan to accept, in principle, all of the recommendations that Sir Martin makes of central government.

We will set out how we plan to do so as quickly as possible.

But I can assure the House – and all those affected by the Grenfell tragedy – that where action is called for, action will follow.

Mr Speaker, for the survivors, the bereaved, and the local community this report will prove particularly harrowing.

Yet I hope it will strengthen their faith in Sir Martin’s desire to determine the facts of the fire – and this government’s commitment to airing those facts in public, no matter how difficult they may be, and acting on them.

That commitment is absolute.

Because if any good is to come of this senseless tragedy – a tragedy that should never have happened…

If it is to become a catalyst for a change in our approach to fire safety and indeed to social housing more widely, then we must get to the truth about what happened and why.

We must expose and fix the failings that allowed an otherwise safe building to become so dangerous…

That allowed a small kitchen fire to become a devastating inferno…

That led to so many people being told to stay in their homes when they could and should have been fleeing to safety.

The inquiry is a vital part of that.

I would like to thank Sir Martin and his team for all their work so far, and I know that all current and former ministers, civil servants and all public sector workers will fully co-operate with phase two.

But while I know that in uncovering the truth is very important to the survivors and bereaved, it is not the only aspect of the post-Grenfell story that requires our attention.

So we will continue – as the previous Prime Minister promised – to support the affected families, long after the television cameras are gone.

We will continue the work of the Grenfell Ministerial Recovery Group, which brings together the efforts of all parts of Government, central and local, in meeting the needs of the community.

We will continue work to ensure that a beautiful and appropriate memorial is created on the site of the tower – a process that is being led by the bereaved and the local community.

We will continue to make sure that those affected by the fire have an active and engaging role to play in implementing the lessons of Grenfell – including working closely with the Ministry of Housing to develop the policies in our social housing white paper.

We will continue to implement the findings of the Hackitt review of building regulations.

And I have asked the civil servants responsible for implementing Sir Martin’s recommendations to provide me with regular and frequent updates on their progress.

I will not allow the lessons of this tragedy to fall through the cracks.

Mr Speaker, the night of 14 June was a horrendous night.

But in the darkness we have also seen the best of humanity.

The residents who sacrificed their own lives to save their children or neighbours.

The local community that rallied around in such an incredible fashion, holding the survivors in a tight embrace as the authorities failed to step up.

And the people here with us today.

The bereaved and the survivors.

Those who would have every reason to hide away, but who have instead fought to uncover the truth about what happened that terrible night.

Who have forced themselves to relive, time and again, the kind of trauma that most of us, mercifully, cannot begin to imagine.

And who have dedicated so much of their lives in so many ways to ensuring that those who died on the 14th June 2017 will always be remembered.

To them I say once again that the truth will out.

That justice will be done.

And that Grenfell Tower and the people who called it home will never be forgotten."
PRE-COVID,PM’s statement in the House: 19 October 2019,https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pms-statement-in-the-house-19-october-2019,Prime Minister,19 October 2019,"Mr Speaker, I am very grateful to you, I am very grateful to the House of Commons staff, everybody who’s put themselves out, everybody who has come to give up their time in this debate today.

It’s been a very important debate, an exceptional moment for our country, an exceptional moment for our Parliament.

Alas the opportunity to have a meaningful vote has been effectively been passed up because the meaningful vote has been voided of meaning.

But I wish the House to know that I’m not daunted or dismayed by this particular result and I think it probably became likely once it was obvious that the amendment from my Right Honourable Friend the Member for West Dorset was going to remain on the order paper.

I continue in the very strong belief that the best thing for the UK and for the whole of Europe is for us to leave with this new deal on October 31.

And to anticipate the questions that are coming from the benches opposite, I will not negotiate a delay with the EU, and neither does the law compel me to do so.

I will tell our friends and colleagues in the EU exactly what I’ve told everyone in the last 88 days that I’ve served as Prime Minister: that further delay would be bad for this country, bad for the European Union and bad for democracy.

So next week the Government will introduce the legislation needed for us to leave the EU with our new deal on October 31.

And I hope that our European Union colleagues and friends will not be attracted as the benches opposite are by delay. I don’t think they’ll be attracted by delay.

And I hope that then Honourable Members faced with a choice of our new deal, our new deal for the UK and the European Union, will change their minds because it was pretty close today. I hope that they will change their minds and support this deal in overwhelming numbers.

Since I became Prime Minister I‘ve said we must get on and get Brexit done on October 31 so that this country can move on.

Mr Speaker, that policy remains unchanged, no delays, and I will continue to do all I can to get Brexit done on October 31 and I continue to commend this excellent deal, Mr Speaker, to the House."
PRE-COVID,PM statement in the House of Commons: 19 October 2019,https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-in-the-house-of-commons-19-october-2019,Prime Minister,19 October 2019,"Mr Speaker, I want to begin by echoing what you’ve just said, my gratitude to all members of the House for assembling on a Saturday for the first time in 37 years and indeed to all members of the House of Commons staff who have worked to make this possible.

I know this has meant people giving up their Saturdays, breaking into their weekends at a time when families want to be together, and of course it means missing at least the end of England’s World Cup quarter final.

I apologies to the House for that and I wish I could watch it myself.

I know the Honourable Member for Cardiff West has postponed his 60th birthday party – if not his 60th birthday – to be here.

So Mr Speaker the House has gone to a great deal of trouble to assemble here on a Saturday for the first time in a generation.

And I do hope for the purposes of a meaningful vote that we will indeed be allowed to have a meaningful vote this evening.

And with permission, Mr Speaker, I shall make a statement on the new agreement with our European friends.

The House will need no reminding that this is the second deal and the fourth vote, three and half years after the nation voted for Brexit.

And during those years, friendships have been strained, families divided and the attention of this House consumed by a single issue that has at times felt incapable of resolution.

But I hope Mr Speaker, that this is the moment when we can finally achieve that resolution and reconcile the instincts that compete within us.

Many times in the last 30 years I have heard our European friends remark that this country is half-hearted in its EU membership and it is true that we in the UK have often been a backmarker opting out of the single currency, not taking part in Schengen, very often trying to block some collective ambition.

And in the last three years and a half years it has been striking that members on all sides of this House have debated Brexit in almost entirely practical terms in an argument that has focused on the balance of economic risk and advantage.

And I don’t think I can recall a time when I have heard a single member stand up and call for Britain to play her full part in the political construction of a federal Europe.

I don’t think I’ve heard a single member call for an ever closer union or ever deeper integration or a federal destiny – mon pays Europe - perhaps I’ve missed it but I don’t think I’ve heard much of it Mr Speaker.

And there is a whole side of that debate that you hear regularly in other European capitals that is simply absent from our national conversation and I don’t think that has changed much in the last 30 years.

But if we have been sceptical, and if we have been anxious about the remoteness of the bureaucracy, if we have been dubious about the rhetoric of union and integration, if we have been half-hearted Europeans,

Then it follows logically that with part of our hearts, with half our hearts, we feel something else, a sense of love and respect for European culture and civilisation of which we are a part; a desire to cooperate with our friends and partners in everything, creatively, artistically, intellectually.

A sense of our shared destiny and a deep understanding of the eternal need – especially after the horrors of the last century - for Britain to stand as one of the guarantors of peace and democracy in our continent.

And it is our continent. And it is precisely because we are capable of feeling both things at once - sceptical about the modes of EU integration as we are but passionate and enthusiastic about Europe - that the whole experience of the last few years has been so difficult for this country and so divisive.

And that is why it is now so urgent for us to move on and build a new relationship with our friends in the EU on the basis of a new deal - a deal that can heal the rift in British politics, unite the warring instincts in us all.

And now is the time for this great House of Commons to come together and bring the country together today as I believe people at home are hoping and expecting, with a new way forward and a new and better deal both for Britain and our friends in the EU, and that is the advantage of the agreement that we have struck with our friends in the last two days.

Because this new deal allows the UK - whole and entire - to leave the EU on October 31st in accordance with the referendum while simultaneously looking forward to a new partnership based on the closest ties of friendship and co-operation.

And I pay tribute to our European friends for escaping the prison of existing positions and showing the vision to be flexible by re-opening the Withdrawal Agreement and thereby addressing the deeply felt concerns of many in this House.

And one of my most important jobs is to express those concerns to our European friends.

I shall continue to listen to all Honourable Members throughout the debate today, to meet with anyone on any side and to welcome the scrutiny the House will bring to bear if - as I hope – we proceed to consider the Withdrawal Agreement Bill next week.

Today this House has an historic opportunity to show the same breadth of vision as our European neighbours.

The same ability and resolve to reach beyond past disagreements by getting Brexit done and moving this country forwards, as we all yearn to do.

This agreement provides for a real Brexit, taking back control of our borders, laws, money, farming, fisheries and trade, amounting to the greatest single restoration of national sovereignty in Parliamentary history.

It removes the backstop which would have held us against our will in the Customs Union and much of the Single Market.

For the first time in almost five decades the UK will be able to strike free trade deals with our friends across the world to benefit the whole country – including Northern Ireland.

Article 4 of the Protocol states: “Northern Ireland is part of the customs territory of the United Kingdom”.

It adds “nothing in this Protocol shall prevent” Northern Ireland from realising the preferential market access in any free trade deals “on the same terms as goods produced in other parts of the United Kingdom.”

Our negotiations have focused on the uniquely sensitive nature of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.

And we have respected those sensitivities.

Above all, we and our European friends have preserved the letter and the spirit of the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement and upheld the long-standing areas of co-operation between the UK and Ireland, including the Common Travel Area.

And as I told the House on 3rd October, in order to prevent a regulatory border on the island of Ireland we proposed a regulatory zone covering all goods, including agrifood, eliminating any need for associated checks along the border.

And Mr Speaker, in this agreement we have gone further by also finding a solution to the vexed question of customs, which many in this House have raised.

Our agreement ensures – and I quote – “unfettered market access for goods moving from Northern Ireland to the rest of the United Kingdom’s internal market.”

It ensures that there should be no tariffs on goods circulating within the UK customs territory, that is between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, unless they are at risk of entering the EU.

It ensures an open border on the island of Ireland, a common objective of everyone in this House.

And it ensures that for those living and working alongside the border there will be no visible or practical changes to their lives – they can carry on as before.

I believe this is a good arrangement, reconciling the special circumstances in Northern Ireland with the minimum possible bureaucratic consequences at a few points of arrival into Northern Ireland.

And it is precisely to ensure that those arrangements are acceptable to the people of Northern Ireland that we have made consent a fundamental element of this new deal.

So no arrangements can be imposed on Northern Ireland if they do not work for Northern Ireland.

The people of Northern Ireland will have the right under this agreement to express or withhold their consent to these provisions, by means of a majority vote in their Assembly four years after the end of the transition.

And if the Assembly chooses to withhold consent, these provisions “shall cease to apply” after two years, during which the Joint Committee of the UK and EU would propose a new way forward, in concert with Northern Ireland’s institutions.

And as soon as this House allows the process of extracting ourselves from the EU to be completed, the exciting enterprise of building our new relationship with our friends can begin which has been too long delayed.

And Mr Speaker, I do not wish this to be the project of any one Government or any one party but rather the endeavour of the United Kingdom as a whole.

Only this Parliament can make this new relationship the work of the nation.

And so Parliament should be at the heart of decision-making as we develop our approach.

And I acknowledge that in the past we have not always acted in that spirit.

So as we take forward our friendship with our closest neighbours and construct that new relationship

I will ensure that a broad and open process draws upon the wealth of expertise in every part of this House including select committees and their chairs.

Every party and every Member who wishes to contribute will be invited to do so.

And we shall start by debating the mandate for our negotiators in the next phase.

Mr Speaker, the ambition for our future friendship is contained in the revised Political Declaration which also provides for this House to be free to decide our own laws and regulations.

I have complete faith in this House to choose regulations that are in our best tradition of the highest standards of environmental protections and workers’ rights.

No one anywhere in this chamber believes in lowering standards, instead we believe in improving them as indeed we will be able to do and seizing the opportunities of our new freedoms.

For example, free from the Common Agricultural Policy, we will have a far simpler system where we will reward farmers for improving our environment and animal welfare many of whose provisions are impossible under the current arrangements, instead of just paying them for their acreage.

And free from the Common Fisheries Policy, we can ensure sustainable yields based on the latest science not outdated methods of setting quotas.

And these restored powers will be available not simply to this Government but to every future British Government of any party to use as they see fit.

That is what restoring sovereignty means, that is what is meant in practice by taking back control of our destiny.

And our first decision, on which I believe there will be unanimity is that in any future trade negotiations with any country our National Health Service will not be on the table.

Mr Speaker, I am convinced that an overwhelming majority in this House, regardless of our personal views, wishes to see Brexit delivered in accordance with the referendum. A majority.

And in this crucial mission there can no longer be any argument for further delay.

As someone who passionately believed that we had to go back to our European friends to seek a better agreement,

I must tell the House that with this new deal the scope for fruitful negotiation has run its course.

They said that we couldn’t re-open the Withdrawal Agreement, Mr Speaker, they said we couldn’t change a comma of the Withdrawal Agreement, they said we couldn’t abolish the backstop, Mr Speaker, we’ve done both.

But it is now my judgement that we have reached the best possible solution.

So those who agree, like me that Brexit must be delivered and who - like me – prefer to avoid a no deal outcome, must abandon the delusion that this House can delay again.

And I must tell the House in all candour that there is very little appetite among our friends in the EU for this business to be protracted by one extra day.

They have had three and a half years of this debate.

It has distracted them from their own projects and their own ambitions and if there is one feeling that unites the British public with a growing number of the officials of the EU it is a burning desire to get Brexit done.

and I must tell the House again in all candour that whatever letters they may seek to force the government to write, it cannot change my judgment that further delay is pointless, expensive and deeply corrosive of public trust.

And people simply will not understand how politicians can say with one breath that they want delay to avoid no deal and then with the next breath that they still want delay when a great deal is there to be done.

Now is the time Mr Speaker to get this thing done, and I say to all members let us come together as democrats to end this debilitating feud.

Let us come together as democrats behind this deal, the one proposition that fulfils the verdict of the majority but which also allows us to bring together the two halves of our hearts, to bring together the two halves of our nation.

Let’s speak now both for the 52 and the 48.

Let us go for a deal that can heal this country, let’s go for a deal that can heal this country and allow us all to express our legitimate desires for the deepest possible friendship and partnership with our neighbours

A deal that allows us to create a new shared destiny with them.

And a deal that also allows us to express our confidence in our own democratic institutions, to make our own laws, to determine our own future, to believe in ourselves once again as an open, generous global, outward-looking and free-trading United Kingdom.

That is the prospect that this deal offers our country.

It is a great prospect and a great deal, and I commend it to the House.

I thank Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the Commission, for all the personal effort that he has put in to getting this deal done. And I want to stress that this is a great deal for our country, for the UK.

I also believe it is a very good deal for our friends in the EU. And what it means is that we in the UK can come out of the EU as one United Kingdom - England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, together, and it means we can decide our future together, we can take back control, as the phrase goes, of our money, our borders, our laws, together.

And we will be able to do free trade agreements around the world. We can also build now, after three and a half years, we can build now on our relations with our friends and partners in the EU.

And it’ll be a very exciting period now, as it were, to get to the positive side of that project - the extraction having been done, the building now begins.

And I’m very confident that when my colleagues in Parliament study this agreement, that they will want to vote for it on Saturday, and then in succeeding days.

This is our chance in the UK as democrats to get Brexit done, and come out on October the 31st. This is our chance to focus on our priorities, the people’s priorities, the NHS, putting 20,000 police on the streets, lifting up funding of education across the country, the biggest expansion of the living wage.

Those are the things I think the people of our country want us to be focusing on in addition to Brexit. We have been at this now, as I say, for three and a half years.

It hasn’t always been an easy experience for the UK. It has been long, it has been painful, it has been divisive, and now is the moment for us as a country to come together.

Now this is the moment for our parliamentarians to come together and get this thing done, and, as I say, to begin building a new and progressive partnership with our EU friends, with whom, of course, we share so many priorities.

PRE-COVID,PM's Commons statement on Brexit negotiations: 3 October 2019,https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pms-commons-statement-on-brexit-negotiations-3-october-2019,Prime Minister,3 October 2019,"With permission, Mr Speaker, I shall make a statement on the government’s proposals for a new agreement with our European friends

that would honour the result of the referendum and deliver Brexit on 31st October - in an orderly way with a deal.

This government’s objective has always been to leave with a deal. And these constructive and reasonable proposals show our seriousness of purpose.

They do not deliver everything that we would have wished. They do represent a compromise.

But to remain a prisoner of existing positions is to become a cause of deadlock rather than breakthrough.

And so we have made a genuine attempt to bridge the chasm, to reconcile the apparently irreconcilable. And to go the extra mile as time runs short.

Our starting point is that this House promised to respect the referendum before the vote. More people voted Leave than voted for any political party in our history.

This referendum must be respected.

Both main parties promised at the 2017 election that they would respect the referendum and there would be no second referendum.

This House voted to trigger Article 50 and has voted repeatedly to leave.

Yet it also voted three times against the previous Withdrawal Agreement and for repeated delay.

And so, as I have emphasised time and again, there can be no path to a deal except by reopening the Withdrawal Agreement and replacing the so-called backstop.

While, as I stand here today, we are some way from a resolution, it is to the credit of our European friends that they have accepted the need to address these issues.

And I welcome the constructive calls I have had over the last twenty-four hours

including with President Juncker, Chancellor Merkel, Taoiseach Varadkar

and the statement from President Juncker that the Commission will now examine the legal text objectively.

The essence of our new proposal is a new Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland consisting of five elements.

In the first place all our actions are based on our shared determination to sustain the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement, the fundamental basis of governance in Northern Ireland

the protection of which is the highest priority of all.

And from this follows the second principle – namely that we shall of course uphold all the longstanding areas of co-operation between the UK and our friends in Ireland

including the rights of all those living in Northern Ireland, North/South co-operation

and the Common Travel Area, which predates both the Good Friday Agreement and the European Union itself.

Third, we propose the potential creation of a regulatory zone on the island of Ireland covering all goods, including agri-food.

For as long as it exists, this zone would eliminate all regulatory checks for trade in goods between Ireland and Northern Ireland.

But fourth, unlike the so-called backstop, such a regulatory zone would be sustained with the consent of the people of Northern Ireland, as expressed through the Assembly and Executive.

They will give their consent during the transition period as a condition for these arrangements entering into force.

Thereafter, the Assembly will vote again every four years - and if consent were withheld, these arrangements would then lapse after one year.

Fifth, it has always been a point of principle for this government that at the end of the transition period, the UK should leave the EU Customs Union whole and entire

restoring sovereign control over our trade policy and opening the way for free trade deals with all our friends around the world.

That is a fundamental point for us, Mr Speaker.

So, under the proposals in this new Protocol, Northern Ireland will be fully part of the UK customs territory not the EU Customs Union.

But there will be no need for checks – or any infrastructure – at or near the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.

Indeed, I have already given a guarantee that the UK government will never conduct checks at the border

and we believe that the EU should do the same, so there is absolute clarity on that point.

Instead under this new Protocol all customs checks between Northern Ireland and Ireland would take place either electronically

or in the small number of cases where physical checks would be necessary, they would happen at traders’ premises or other points in the supply chain.

We have put forward a method for achieving this

based on improving and simplifying existing rules, trusting certain traders and strengthening our co-operation with Ireland

in a spirit of friendship and sensitivity to the particular circumstances.

So while these proposals will mean changes from the situation that prevails today in Ireland and Northern Ireland

it is their driving purpose to minimise any disruption.

And in order to support the transition further we propose a New Deal for Northern Ireland

that will boost economic growth and competitiveness

and set in train new infrastructure, particularly with a cross-border focus.

Mr Speaker, the previous Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration would have permanently anchored the United Kingdom within the orbit of EU regulation and customs arrangements.

And an indefinite so-called backstop provided a bridge to that vision of the future.

This Government has a different vision – basing our future relationship with our European neighbours on a Free Trade Agreement

and allowing the UK to take back control of our trade policy and our regulations.

And we propose to amend the Political Declaration to reflect this ambition.

Our proposals should now provide the basis for rapid negotiations towards a solution in the short time that remains.

I do not for one moment resile from the fact that we have shown great flexibility in the interests of reaching an accommodation with our European friends

and achieving the resolution for which we all yearn.

If our European neighbours choose not to show a corresponding willingness to reach a deal

then we shall have to leave on 31st October without an agreement

and we are ready to do so.

But that outcome would be a failure of statecraft for which all parties would be held responsible.

When I think of the conflicts that have wracked Europe in the past

of the immense challenges that we have together surmounted

of the 74 years of peace and prosperity we have together achieved

I believe that surely we can summon the collective will to reach a new agreement.

Mr Speaker, this government has moved

our proposals do represent a compromise

and I hope the House can now come together in the national interest

behind this new deal.

To open a new chapter of friendship with our European neighbours

and move on to our domestic priorities – including education, infrastructure and our NHS.

So Mr Speaker, let us seize this moment

to honour our over-riding promise to the British people

respect Brexit

and get Brexit done

and I commend this Statement to the House.

It is customary for the British Prime Minister to come to this United Nations and pledge to advance our values and defend our rules, the rules of a peaceful world.

From protecting freedom of navigation in the Gulf

To persevering in the vital task of achieving a two-state solution to the conflict in the Middle East.

And of course I am proud to do all of these things.

But no-one can ignore a gathering force that is reshaping the future of every member of this Assembly.

There has been nothing like it in history

When I think of the great scientific revolutions of the past - print, the steam engine, aviation, the atomic age - I think of new tools that we acquired but over which we - the human race - had the advantage,

Which we controlled.

That is not necessarily the case in the digital age.

You may keep secrets from your friends, from your parents, your children, your doctor – even your personal trainer – but it takes real effort to conceal your thoughts from Google.

And if that is true today, in future there may be nowhere to hide.

Smart cities will pullulate with sensors, all joined together by the “internet of things”, bollards communing invisibly with lamp posts

So there is always a parking space for your electric car,

so that no bin goes unemptied, no street unswept,

and the urban environment is as antiseptic as a Zurich pharmacy.

But this technology could also be used to keep every citizen under round-the-clock surveillance.

A future Alexa will pretend to take orders.

But this Alexa will be watching you,

Clucking her tongue and stamping her foot

In the future, voice connectivity will be in every room and almost every object:

your mattress will monitor your nightmares; your fridge will beep for more cheese,

your front door will sweep wide the moment you approach, like some silent butler; your smart meter will go hustling - if its accord - for the cheapest electricity.

And every one of them minutely transcribing your every habit in tiny electronic shorthand,

Stored not in their chips or their innards - nowhere you can find it,

But in some great cloud of data that lours ever more oppressively over the human race

A giant dark thundercloud

waiting to burst

And we have no control over how or when the precipitation will take place

And every day that we tap on our phones or work on our ipads - as I see some of you doing now -

We not only leave our indelible spoor in the ether

But we are ourselves becoming a resource

Click by click, tap by tap.

Just as the carboniferous period created the indescribable wealth - leaf by decaying leaf - of hydrocarbons.

Data is the crude oil of the modern economy

And we are now in an environment where

We don’t know who should own these new oil fields

We don’t always know who should have the rights or the title to these gushers of cash

And we don’t know who decides how to use that data

Can these algorithms be trusted with our lives and hopes?

Should the machines - and only the machines - decide whether or not we are eligible for a mortgage or insurance

Or what surgery or medicines we should receive?

Are we doomed to a cold and heartless future in which computer says yes - or computer says no

With the grim finality of an emperor in the arena?

How do you plead with an algorithm? How do you get it to see the extenuating circumstances

And how do we know that the machines have not been insidiously programmed to fool us or even to cheat us?

We already use all kinds of messaging services that offer instant communication at minimal cost.

The same programmes, platforms, could also be designed for real-time censorship of every conversation, with offending words automatically deleted, indeed in some countries this happens today.

Digital authoritarianism is not, alas, the stuff of dystopian fantasy but of an emerging reality.

The reason I am giving this speech today is that the UK is one of the world’s tech leaders - and I believe governments have been simply caught unawares by the unintended consequences of the internet;

A scientific breakthrough more far-reaching in its everyday psychological impact than any other invention since Gutenberg

And when you consider how long it took for books to come into widespread circulation

The arrival of the internet is far bigger than print

It is bigger than the atomic age -

But it is like nuclear power in that it is capable of both good and harm - but of course it is not alone

As new technologies seem to race towards us from the far horizon

We strain our eyes as they come, to make out whether they are for good or bad - friends or foes?

AI - what will it mean?

Helpful robots washing and caring for an ageing population?

or pink eyed terminators sent back from the future to cull the human race?

What will synthetic biology stand for - restoring our livers and our eyes with miracle regeneration of the tissues, like some fantastic hangover cure?

Or will it bring terrifying limbless chickens to our tables.

Will nanotechnology help us to beat disease, or will it leave tiny robots to replicate in the crevices of our cells?

It is a trope as old as literature that any scientific advance is punished by the Gods

When Prometheus brought fire to mankind

In a tube of fennel, as you may remember, that Zeus punished him by chaining him to a tartarean crag while his liver was pecked out by an eagle

And every time his liver regrew the eagle came back and pecked it again

And this went on for ever - a bit like the experience of Brexit in the UK, if some of our parliamentarians had their way.

In fact it was standard poetic practice to curse the protos heuretes - the person responsible for any scientific or technical breakthrough

If only they had never invented the ship, then Jason would never have sailed to Colchis and all sorts of disasters would never have happened

And it is a deep human instinct to be wary of any kind of technical progress

In 1829 they thought the human frame would not withstand the speeds attained by Stephenson’s rocket

And there are today people today who are actually still anti-science.

A whole movement called the anti-Vaxxers, who refuse to acknowledge the evidence that vaccinations have eradicated smallpox

And who by their prejudices are actually endangering the very children they want to protect

And I totally reject this anti-scientific pessimism.

I am profoundly optimistic about the ability of new technology to serve as a liberator and remake the world wondrously and benignly,

indeed in countless respects technology is

already doing just that.

Today, nanotechnology - as I mentioned earlier - is revolutionising medicine by designing robots a fraction of the size of a red blood cell,

capable of swimming through our bodies, dispensing medicine and attacking malignant cells like some Star Wars armada

Neural interface technology is producing a new generation of cochlear implants,

allowing the gift of hearing to people who would not otherwise be able to hear the voices of their children.

A London technology company has worked out how to help the blind to navigate more freely with nothing more than an app on their smartphones -

New technologies, produced in Britain, helping the deaf to hear and the blind to see.

And we used to think that printing was something you did to run off a boarding card

Now a British company has used 3D printing to make an engine capable of blasting a rocket into space.

In African countries, millions of people without bank accounts can now transfer money using a simple app;

they can buy solar energy and leap in one transaction from no electricity to green power.

And new advances are making renewable energy ever cheaper, aiding our common struggle against climate change.

Our understanding of the natural world is being transformed by genome sequencing.

The discovery of the very essence of life itself

The secret genetic code that animates the spirit of every living being.

And allows medical breakthroughs the like of which we have never known.

Treatments tailored to the precise genetic makeup of the individual.

So far, we have discovered the secrets of less than 0.3 percent of complex life on the planet,

Think what we will achieve when – and it is a matter of when – we understand 1 or 2 percent, let alone 5 or 10 percent.

But how we design the emerging technologies behind these breakthroughs – and what values inform their design –will shape the future of humanity. That is my point to you tonight my friends, my Excellencies -

At stake is whether we bequeath an Orwellian world, designed for censorship, repression and control,

or a world of emancipation, debate and learning, where technology threatens famine and disease, but not our freedoms.

Seven decades ago, this General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights with no dissenting voices,

uniting humanity for the first and perhaps only time behind one set of principles.

And our declaration - our joint declaration - upholds “freedom of opinion and expression”,

the “privacy” of “home or correspondence,”

and the right to “seek…and impart information and ideas”.

Unless we ensure that new technology reflects this spirit, I fear that our declaration will mean nothing and no longer hold.

So the mission of the United Kingdom and all who share our values must be to ensure that emerging technologies are designed from the outset for freedom, openness and pluralism,

with the right safeguards in place to protect our peoples.

Month by month, vital decisions are being taken in academic committees, company boardrooms and industry standards groups.

They are writing the rulebooks of the future, making ethical judgements, choosing what will or will not be rendered possible.

Together, we need to ensure that new advances reflect our values by design.

There is excellent work being done in the EU, the Commonwealth, and of course the UN,

which has a vital role in ensuring that no country is excluded from the wondrous benefits of this technology, and the industrial revolution it is bringing about.

But we must be still more ambitious.

We need to find the right balance between freedom and control; between innovation and regulation; between private enterprise and government oversight.

We must insist that the ethical judgements inherent in the design of new technology are transparent to all.

And we must make our voices heard more loudly in the standards bodies that write the rules.

Above all, we need to agree a common set of global principles to shape the norms and standards that will guide the development of emerging technology.

So - here’s the good news - I invite you next year to a summit in London, a wonderful city, where by the way it is not raining 94 per cent of the time, and where at one stage - when I was Mayor of London - we discovered that we had more Michelin starred restaurants even than Paris. The French somehow rapidly recovered - by a process that I wasn’t quite sure was entirely fair. But we still have by far, in the UK, by far the biggest tech sector - fintech, biotech, meditech, nanotech, green tech - every kind of tech - in London - the biggest tech sector anywhere in Europe, perhaps half a million people working in tech alone.

I hope you will come there, where we will seek to assemble the broadest possible coalition to take forward this vital task

Building on all that the UK can contribute to this mission as a global leader in ethical and responsible technology.

If we master this challenge – and I have no doubt that we can – then we will not only safeguard our ideals,

we will surmount the limits that once constrained humanity and conquer the perils that once ended so many lives.

Together, we can vanquish killer diseases, eliminate famine,

protect the environment and transform our cities.

Success will depend, now as ever, on freedom, openness and pluralism,

the formula that not only emancipates the human spirit, but releases the boundless ingenuity and inventiveness of mankind,

and which, above all, the United Kingdom will strive to preserve and advance.

Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you for your kind attention."
PRE-COVID,"Joint statement by the heads of state and government of France, Germany and the United Kingdom",https://www.gov.uk/government/news/joint-statement-by-the-heads-of-state-and-government-of-france-germany-and-the-united-kingdom,Prime Minister,23 September 2019,"We, the leaders of France, Germany and the United Kingdom, recall our shared common security interests, in particular upholding the global non-proliferation regime and preserving stability in the Middle East.

We condemn in the strongest terms the attacks on oil facilities on Saudi territory on September 14th, 2019 in Abqaiq and Khurais, and reaffirm in this context our full solidarity with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and its population.

It is clear to us that Iran bears responsibility for this attack. There is no other plausible explanation. We support ongoing investigations to establish further details.

These attacks may have been against Saudi Arabia but they concern all countries and increase the risk of a major conflict. They underline the importance of making collective efforts towards regional stability and security, including finding a political solution to the ongoing conflict in Yemen. The attacks also highlight the necessity of de-escalation in the region through sustained diplomatic efforts and engagement with all parties.

In this regard, we recall our continued commitment to the JCPoA, agreed with Iran on July 14th, 2015 and unanimously endorsed by the UN Security Council. We urge Iran once again to reverse its decisions to reduce compliance with the deal and to adhere fully to its commitments under it. We call upon Iran to cooperate fully with the IAEA in the framework of the JCPoA and its Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement.

Conscious of the importance of collective efforts to guarantee regional stability and security, we reiterate our conviction that the time has come for Iran to accept negotiation on a long-term framework for its nuclear programme as well as on issues related to regional security, including its missiles programme and other means of delivery.

We are committed to continuing our diplomatic efforts to create conditions and facilitate dialogue with all relevant partners interested in de-escalation of tensions in the Middle East, in the interest of preserving international peace and security, building upon our joint declaration on July 14th, 2019 and G7 conclusions adopted in Biarritz. We urge Iran to engage in such a dialogue and refrain from further provocation and escalation.

PRE-COVID,PM speech at Hudson Yards business event: 24 September 2019,https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-speech-at-hudson-yards-business-event-24-september-2019,Prime Minister,24 September 2019,"Thank you very much for that welcome and I’m very, very proud to be standing here in front of this incredible creation which of course symbolises my message to you this morning.

Because it is designed by the same man who sculpted the beautiful domes of the London Routemaster bus.

I’m proud also to be the first Prime Minister of the UK to be born in New York – a very, very, very expensive decision that that turned out to be.

And it’s a very exciting time in our country, we’re getting on with delivering Brexit and I just want to say a word or two about that.

Because there’s been a court case in our country this morning of which I – it would be remiss or wrong of me not to address that directly and we’ve got our friends from the UK media here as well - and I just want to say to everybody watching back home for the avoidance of doubt, I have the highest respect of course for our judiciary and the independence of our courts

But I must say, I strongly disagree with this judgement, and we in the UK will not be deterred from getting on and delivering on the will of the people to come out of the EU on October 31st.

Because we were mandated to do.

And we will simultaneously refuse to be deterred from delivering on what I think you will all expect to be an exciting dynamic, domestic agenda intended to make our country even more attractive to live in and to invest in.

So we are pushing on with infrastructure, investing in police, investment in our NHS and to do that we will need a Queen’s speech to set out what we are going to do.

And I think frankly, that is what the people in my country of the UK want to see.

They want to see us delivering on getting on with a strong domestic agenda and believe you me, they want to see Brexit delivered by October 31st.

Anyway that’s what you need to know about what’s happening in the court today.

But I can tell you that under any circumstances, court judgements or otherwise my heart lifts when I come to New York.

There’s something amazing, the snap, fizz, the energy in this city.

I love the blue sky, against the sky scrapers, the weird strange Martian water towers on the tops of the buildings.

It’s the things that in New York you never find anywhere else.

But there are many ways in which New York and London are not just similar but actually united.

And it isn’t just that we share a language – kind of.

We have a basic idea of freedom, the idea that common to our democracies.

That if you obey the law and you do no harm to others then you can come and live your life as you please.

Without being judged or censured.

And it is the excitement of that freedom that brings people of talent to New York as it brings people to London.

And so you get this cyclotron effect the flash of inspiration that leads to innovation and to prosperity and growth.

And very often it will be a synthesis between American and British ideas.

We invented for instance the underground train.

You invented the safety brake elevator - take them together and you’ve got the recipe for a metropolis.

And you can see the same fusion today across our cities in every sphere from tech to the arts to newspapers.

You know the figures, actually they’re going up I think around 1.2 million US people employed by UK companies and a million or more in the UK,

Trade now worth 200 billion a year, going up the whole time.

Colossal investment.

But to cut to the chase, we now want to do so much more – because our country is going up.

And on October 31 the UK intends to be more global, more outward-looking and more committed to the rest of the world than ever before.

And we are going to take advantage of all the freedoms that Brexit can give.

Whether that is new tax allowances for investment.

Or speeding up public procurement contracts.

Or creating new free ports and enterprise zones.

Or devising better regulation for sectors in which the UK leads the world – whether that’s bioscience or financial services or whatever.

More competitive tax rates and the best skilled workforce in the hemisphere.

And so I say to everybody who’s done me the honour of coming this morning to this breakfast, we will roll out the red carpet for our American friends.

And we are increasing the number of visas for scientists.

We are ensuring that your brilliant students can stay on for two years so as to get real value from their studies.

And so that our economy in the UK benefits from their expertise.

We are even ensuring that US visitors are able to use the electronic e-passport system at Heathrow.

And yes - we want to do the much wanted free trade deal. I’m not saying it’s going to be easy because there will be things that we do not want our NHS to be on the table, and there will be differences.

And I am glad that President Trump has set up the special relationship economic working group.

Because it is absolutely absurd that there should be tariffs on Californian wine.

Or that British shoppers should be pay over the odds for Florida orange juice.

But it is also absurd and indefensible that the population of America to the best of my knowledge has gone for decades without eating a morsel of British lamb, or beef.

Let alone haggis.

And I have discovered that anyone wanting to sell socks to the United States.

I think they at least face a tariff of up to 19 per cent. I was told that some kinds have been taken to a laboratory and set fire to twice.

There are only certain ports in the United States that are licenced to receive British cauliflower.

And the US military are banned from buying British tape measures as though there was still some kind of general prejudice still against British rulers.

So I ask you, my friends, is this really necessary?

Let us work together to break down these barriers that have been devised by bureaucrats.

Because all the evidence of the last two centuries is that free trade is the fastest and most effective way to increase the prosperity of our people.

This year our country the UK takes a giant step out into the world.

In keeping with our traditions but also with our new ambitions.

To build on our friendships and relationships with our friends in Europe, the US and Canada.

We do it with confidence to make Britain the best place in the world to start, to build and to run a business.

The place you will want to be.

The place you will want your business to be.

And that’s why I say to everyone here – come and join us.

Thank you very much."
PRE-COVID,PM sets out plans to give the North more control of rail services,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-sets-out-plans-to-give-the-north-more-control-of-rail-services,Prime Minister,13 September 2019,"In a speech in Rotherham today, the Prime Minister set out his intention to allow Northern communities to take more control over their services.

This means local people will have more power over how their trains are run, including the frequency and fares, as well as allowing them to hold local providers to account.

This is another step in delivering the Prime Minister’s pledge to level up the whole country so that people can achieve more and have equal, fairer opportunities.

“Today I am announcing my intention to give the railways of the north back to the people of the north. Back to the places where they were born. Back to Stockton and to Darlington. Back to Liverpool and Manchester,” the Prime Minister said.

“On local lines in metropolitan areas, we will give greater control over fares, service patterns, rolling stock and stations.

“And outside the combined authority areas, I want communities to take control too.

“That might be through county councils taking on similar roles, in their areas, for stations or branch lines. Or it might be by transferring local branch line and rural services to community rail partnerships, owned by local people.

“And as you have asked, we will give you far greater control over your budgets.”

The Prime Minister said that many of the North’s best services, including Merseyrail, the Manchester Metrolink, and the Nexus Tyne & Wear Metro, are already run by, or on behalf of, locally elected politicians. “They’re always going to care more about their trains and trams than someone in Whitehall,” he said.

The Prime Minister also said that “in this birthplace of the railways, we can do so much better. Today – coming from London on the train, it took me just over an hour and a half to get to Doncaster. But if, for example, you travelled from Liverpool to Rotherham – less than half the distance – you might have had to leave an hour earlier than me, and change as many as three times.”

He lamented that fact that many Northern cities still have “to put up with old diesel trains, running once or twice an hour, from stations where the only form of welcome on the platform is a bus shelter.”

However, drawing on his experience as Mayor of London, the Prime Minister warned that “as well as taking power, you will have to take responsibility. That means alongside taking the credit, you will be taking the heat.”

He also made clear that the North’s railways must remain part of a national network, which is what passengers want.

The move to hand down more control, in partnership with the railways, is one of the recommendations from the Williams Rail Review, led by independent chair Keith Williams.

The Government is currently delivering the biggest rail investment since the Victorian era - spending a record £48 billion improving our railways to deliver better journeys.

In the North specifically, Northern has invested £500m on 101 new trains - the first of which entered service in July, and the first of the old Pacers being withdrawn in August.

£100m is being spent on the refurbishment of every other Northern train, whilst TransPennine Express have started introducing 44 brand new intercity trains connecting the cities of the north of England and Scotland."
PRE-COVID,PM speech at Convention of the North in Rotherham,https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-speech-at-convention-of-the-north-in-rotherham,Prime Minister,13 September 2019,"It’s great to be here in Rotherham, in the magna centre which is of course the plural of magnum which as every knows is the Latin for ice cream

And great to be at the biggest ever convention of the north

Only right that we are meeting here on the banks of the Don, literally the crucible in which the history of the nation was forged - and indeed of the modern world

When nelson defeated the French at Trafalgar and set this country on course for about 100 years of imperial expansion, the cannons on HMS Victory were forged here at Walker and Company

It was Rotherham pipes that brought fresh drinking water to Hong Kong, Rotherham steel that clad Brunel’s Great Eastern and formed the skeletons of New York skyscrapers and did you know that every fire hydrant in New York was cast in British steel less than two miles from here at the works of Guest and Chrimes.

That was before it occurred to anyone to put tariffs on British steel

This place where we meet was so central to our national life that it was bombed in both the first and second world wars

And so it was entirely fitting that 50 years ago the works here at Templeborough adopted as its logo the phoenix – perpetually rising from the ashes

And across this region you can feel that phoenix-like transformation as the Northern Powerhouse – which Jake just spoke so eloquently - thrums into life with a low-carbon, fuel efficient roar

Look at Catcliffe.

Where a factory that once made superb glass is now being used by McLaren to turn super-light, super-strong Yorkshire carbon fibre into the fastest production cars on earth

Right next door, at the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre, Xeros Technology are producing the world’s most environmentally friendly washing machine

That’s the spin and I bet it’s true

Boeing chose Sheffield as its first civil aerospace factory in Europe – with nearly half its employees taken on as apprentices.

And did anybody have a bagel this morning? Did you? No?

Well if you did, it was probably made just up the road in Mexborough, where, in the largest bagel factory in Europe produces fully three-quarters of the bagels eaten in Britain every day.

Sheffield is the home of the UK’s largest provider of hybrid and electric vehicle drive systems, a company called Magtec.

A world-first initiative, Magtec is retrofitting Sheffield’s refuse lorries with battery-power, with enough juice to negotiate the seven hills and recharge themselves with energy they generate from the very rubbish they collect.

Rubbish powered rubbish vans – there’s a joke there somewhere which I will leave to you.

I tell you, there is no limit to the imagination, innovation, ingenuity and leadership in the North.

And I have a profound belief that talent and genius are uniformly distributed around the UK.

But opportunity is not, and that is why we need to level up across our amazing country, and we need investment in education, the giant precondition that determines whether you have the freedom and the confidence to make the most of your talent

So this government will give every child the world class education they deserve.

We are levelling up across the country

Investing an extra £14 billion over three years and increasing the minimum level of funding for every pupil in primary and secondary schools.

We’re backing the teachers who change our lives

We are putting up salaries for new teachers, funding pension increases, and giving teachers the backing they need to deal with disruptive pupils.

And we cannot afford any longer the chronic under-funding of our brilliant FE colleges, which do so much to support young people’s skills and our economy.

It is absurd that employers have been driven to import so much skilled labour from abroad, in large part because of the failures of vocational training in our own country.

We have a world class universities sector – we should be very, very, very proud of it -and it is time we aspired to the same status for our further education institutions, to give everyone the opportunity to express their talents.

And of course education is not enough on its own, you need to be able to connect with other people

To get that job interview, to find that customer

And so we in this new government are supporting gigabit broadband – which is a lot I understand - for every home by 2025, eight years earlier than previously promised.

And they can do it Spain. If they can do it in Spain, why can’t we do it in the UK?

We have a new stronger town fund – a £3.6bn stronger town fund

So that local people can invest in libraries, parks, youth clubs areas, places to bring people together

And that kind of intervention cannot come, cannot be redirected, from central government

So let’s be frank about we’re trying to do, what is needed most of all in addition to the technology, the infrastructure and the education we’re suppling,

It’s of course local leadership.

Trusting people, to take back control and run things the way that they want to.

Because of course central government cannot abdicate responsibility, but only local champions can really make a difference for their towns and their communities.

I am the first Prime Minister since Clement Attlee to have been a mayor – and I know the transformative potential of local, accountable leadership.

Someone with the power to sort out what matters most to local people

What we want to see in this region is towns and communities able to represent that gentlemen and sort out his needs, and whether it’s transport they use to get to work, or good housing – whatever it happens to be

Someone to drive big infrastructure projects, to boost investment, to wave the flag for the area and act as a local champion and say: “Come and invest here.”

But of course along with that power, comes responsibility and accountability.

And it’s time we gave more people a say over the places where they live.

We are going to do devolution properly. We are going to maximise the power of the north with more mayors across the whole of the north.

And I know there is real enthusiasm for devolution in Yorkshire and I welcome the establishment of a Yorkshire Committee as a practical step for facilitating greater collaboration on a Yorkshire-wide basis.

In the meantime, we are committed to getting the Sheffield City Region done – and I also want to open up negotiations with Leeds and West Yorkshire so we can make a mayor work there too, whatever the nature of any longer term arrangements in Yorkshire.

But I also want to build on the fantastic job so many mayors are already doing – and ensure you can deliver on ambitious commitments to your communities.

That will mean levelling up powers for existing mayors

And to make sure our great Northern Powerhouse is firing on all its cylinders, to champion investment and opportunity, we are going to work with leaders across the north, the mayors, local businesses and others to create a new, stronger Northern Powerhouse growth body. It will be a genuine partnership across the region, led by a northerner chosen in close consultation with you. I imagine there will be a process to work out who’s going to do but it will be done in close consultation with you.

But if there is one field of policy that can change people’s lives for the better

And level up opportunity – on field of policy that in my view must now be devolved – that policy is transport

Nearly two hundred years ago, this country invented a machine that went on to unite great surfaces, great areas of Great Britain, spread its iron web across the earth and it transformed everywhere it touched.

The North of England gave the world the railway.

And at a time when the rest of the human race could travel no faster than a galloping horse,

40,000 people watched as Locomotion One puffed its way like some fire breathing beast along the tracks between Stockton and Darlington in 1825.

It was ours, a world first, the common ancestor of both the McLaren and the rubbish eating dustcart I just described

And yet two centuries later, in this birthplace of the railways, we can do so much better

Today – coming from London on the train, it took me just over an hour and a half to get to Doncaster.

But if, for example, you travelled from Liverpool to Rotherham – less than half the distance– you might have had to leave an hour earlier than me, and change as many as three times.

Your journey may have been on two and three-carriage trains, some of them built in the early 1980s with a body designed for a bus. And maybe bus seats too.

I love buses – but not when they are supposed to be trains

When I was in Yorkshire last week, I reaffirmed my commitment to Northern Powerhouse Rail

And I eagerly await your plans.

And before we get on with a project of that scale I deeply believe in the absolute importance of everyday ordinary transport that people rely on.

There are some terrific local transport services in the North – from Manchester’s trams and Mersey rail, the most punctual railway in Britain, to the Tyne and Wear Metro.

And there has been some very significant Government investment with 2,000 additional services now operating each week, £500m on new trains, £100m on the refurbishment of the rest – including WiFi and power sockets. And as well as the electrification of the railways in the North West,

And the Pacers will be gone within months.

But still the overall picture is patchy.

All too often, Northern England has to put up with old diesel trains, running once or twice an hour, from stations where the only form of welcome on the platform is yes, a bus shelter.

William Wordsworth campaigned furiously against the railway coming to the Lake District.

Last year, during the timetable meltdown, Northern and Network Rail gave him his wish.

And what’s the difference between the superb services like Merseyrail, the Tyne and Wear Metro, the Manchester Metrolink and the ones let you down far too often.

Well partly the answer is money

But the other difference is accountability – right answer from the mayors in the front.

Each of those well run services is run by, or on behalf of, locally elected politicians.

And they’re always going to care more about their trains and trams than someone in Whitehall.

London was just the same. Before 2000, when London Transport was run by central government, the tube was frankly shabby and neglected. But when my predecessor and I ran it as London Mayor, services improved

Though I can’t speak for the current incumbent

So today I am announcing my intention to give the railways of the north back to the people of the north. Back to the places where they were born. Back to Stockton and to Darlington. Back to Liverpool and Manchester.

In the combined authority or joint transport committee areas in the North East, West Yorkshire, Sheffield City Region, Greater Manchester, Liverpool City Region, it is time for the north to run its own trains. Keith Williams, who is leading a review of the railways for us, has I think been in touch with most of the people concerned.

On your local lines in metropolitan areas, we will give greater control over fares, service patterns, rolling stock and stations.

And outside the combined authority areas, I want communities to take control too

That might be through county councils taking on similar roles, in their areas, for stations or branch lines.

Or it might be by transferring local branch line and rural services to community rail partnerships, owned by local people.

And as you have asked, we will give you far greater control over your budgets.

But as well as taking power, this is the kicker, you will have to take responsibility. That means alongside taking the credit, you will be taking the heat.

Just like a mayor has to in London. Nobody blames the government for problems on the Central Line. They blame the Mayor of London.

Now we will be generous on capital spending, but we won’t be able to afford everything that everyone wants. So choices will have to be made. And if you people want more than we can afford, then they will have to raise the money themselves.

And, of course, the north’s railways must still be part of the national network which passengers tell us they want, with many trains obviously running across the boundaries of the region. So there still has to be a role for the centre.

This will be a partnership between the railway and the leaders of the north. And I think it’s a formula that can work and will deliver better services for the people of this country.

And that is how we do it. That is how we level up and unleash the talent of the whole country

Better education,

Gigabit broadband sprouting in every home

Reliable comfortable and affordable transport with someone accountable delivering your service

These are the pumping pistons that will drive the northern powerhouse

And that Northern Powerhouse is turning before our eyes into a new locomotive for the UK economy

Two centuries ago this region literally became the engine that propelled the world to new discoveries and new horizons – bringing people together, bringing countries together and bringing new opportunities for everyone.

That is what the Northern Powerhouse can achieve in the 21st century and this is a Government that will back you to deliver it."
PRE-COVID,Prime Minister pledges to bring shipbuilding back to the UK,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-minister-pledges-to-bring-shipbuilding-back-to-the-uk,Prime Minister,12 September 2019,"Thousands of jobs in the British shipping industry will be created over the next decade, the Prime Minister will announce on Thursday, as he pledges to bring shipbuilding back to the UK and strengthen the Royal Navy.

During a visit to a ship in the Thames for London International Shipping Week the Prime Minister will announce which bidder’s design has been selected for new Type 31 warships. The UK Government has committed to buying at least five of these cutting edge vessels for the Royal Navy, with more expected to be exported to governments around the world. The first British Type 31 ship will be in the water by 2023.

The Type 31 programme will support over 2,500 jobs across the UK, with different elements of the frigates being assembled and built at British shipyards. At least 150 of these jobs will be for new technical apprenticeships. The ships will be built exclusively in the UK.

Today’s announcement forms part of the Prime Minister’s commitment to reinvigorate the British shipbuilding industry, ensuring British design and building expertise, in military and commercial shipping, is once again at the heart of this important international market.

The new Type 31 ships will build on the exporting success of the Type 26 frigates, which were designed in the UK and will soon be sailing as part of the British, Australian and Canadian navies.

The Government is also committed to realising the UK’s potential to be a world leader in commercial shipbuilding, particularly for cruise ships, ferries and yachts. The leisure, superyacht and small commercial marine sector expanded by 1.7 per cent last year, its seventh consecutive year of growth. Last year the UK was third in global yacht building rankings.

To realise this shipbuilding ambition, the Prime Minister has appointed Defence Secretary Ben Wallace as Shipbuilding Tsar. As part of this brief the Defence Secretary will work across government to enhance the UK’s shipbuilding enterprise, including with the Department for Education, BEIS and the Department for International Trade which this week launches a new Maritime Trade and Investment Plan.

The Prime Minister has tasked Ben Wallace with looking at how the government can use Further Education, skilled apprenticeships and graduates to achieve a sustainable, longer term skills base for British shipbuilding across the UK. This will ensure that British shipyards are able to compete fairly for all UK government contracts as we leave the EU.

The Prime Minister’s commitment to reinvigorating the British shipbuilding industry will also strengthen and enhance the capabilities of the Royal Navy and those of our international partners and allies.

The Government has pledged to maintain a surface fleet of at least 19 frigates and destroyers and to grow this fleet in the 2030s. The first batch of five Type 31 frigates will help achieve this, by replacing Type 23 frigates.

At a time where the challenges across the world’s seas are increasing, the Type 31 frigates will enable the UK to undertake more missions such as the interception and disruption of those breaching international maritime law, intelligence collection and protecting commercial shipping.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said:

UK is an outward-looking island nation, and we need a shipbuilding industry and Royal Navy that reflect the importance of the seas to our security and prosperity.

This is an industry with a deep and visceral connection to so many parts of the UK and to the Union itself. My government will do all it can to develop this aspect of our heritage and the men and women who make up its workforce – from apprentices embarking on a long career, to those families who have worked in shipyards for generations.

I look forward to the restoration of British influence and excellence across the world’s oceans. I am convinced that by working together we will see a renaissance in this industry which is so much part of our island story – so let’s bring shipbuilding home.

Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said:

These mighty ships will from the next generation of the Royal Navy fleet. The Type 31 frigates will be a fast, agile and versatile warship, projecting power and influence across the globe. The ships will be vital to the Royal Navy’s mission to keeping peace, providing life-saving humanitarian aid and safeguarding the economy across the world from the North Atlantic, to the Gulf, and in the Asia Pacific.

Secretary of State for International Trade, Liz Truss, said:

We will make the Type 31 frigate an export success. Like the Type 26 before it, there has been significant interest in the design and capabilities of the Type 31 from around the world. Countries are modernising their fleets to safeguard against 21st century naval threats and British-built vessels and maritime technology are in high demand. An outward looking United Kingdom will seize this opportunity as we leave the EU."
PRE-COVID,PM press statement with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: 9 September 2019,https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-press-statement-with-taoiseach-leo-varadkar-9-september-2019,Prime Minister,9 September 2019,"Thank you Leo and it is wonderful to be here. And I thank you very much for the warm welcome you’ve given us. You and I first met a few years ago when you and I jointly officiated at the St Patrick’s Day parade in Trafalgar square in London. It was a pretty joyous occasion. And of course we celebrated the incalculable contribution of the Irish community to London.

And there in the vast crowds was of course the living human embodiment of one of the densest and most intricate and most vital relationships in the world between any two countries.

And together Leo today we both recognise that our peoples are the beneficiaries of the efforts of our predecessors – politicians and others – who put aside differences, who found compromises, who took our countries forwards together in circumstances far tougher than now. And the results for both UK and Ireland are immense.

Not just a peaceful and open border but an economic partnership by which we eat I think 50 per cent of all the cheese and beef produced in Ireland, and we are talking a lot. And the very captain of the world cup winning English cricket team was born in this city.

And I think that our job now is to take that relationship forward and to build on it at the UK-Ireland summit in November, I look forward to that, and in all the ways in which the UK and Ireland work together around the world with shared values and shared interests.

As you rightly say Taoiseach, before November there are two political tasks that we simply have to do. We must restore the government of Northern Ireland at Stormont, and I promise to work with you on our shared objective. And we must get Brexit done because the UK must come out on October 31, or else I fear that permanent damage will be done to confidence in our democracy in the UK.

And I know that this problem of Brexit was not, to be perfectly frank, a conundrum that Ireland ever wished for and I think there are three basic questions we need now to answer for the sake of our collective peace of mind.

Can we ensure that we continue to have unchecked movement at the border of goods and people and indeed cattle? I think the answer is yes – and as someone who went to the border several times before the Good Friday agreement, and shuddered to see watchtowers on UK soil, I can say now that the UK will never ever institute checks at the border, and I hope our friends in the EU would say the same.

Can we uphold the Belfast Good Friday agreement in all its particulars? Again I say the answer is yes, and our commitment to the peace process is unshakeable. Can we protect the economic unity of the island of Ireland and the gains that Ireland has won through its membership of the EU single market? And again I think the answer is yes – and I think we can achieve all these things while allowing the UK to withdraw whole and entire from the EU.

And of course I acknowledge the complexities involved. And the symbolism and the sensitivities evoked by the very concept of a border. But strip away the politics and at the core of each problem you find practical issues that can be resolved. With sufficient energy and a spirit of compromise, and indeed even the current treaty must logically envisage that the problems can be solved, or the present protocol would never have been called a backstop.

So if I have one message that I want to land with you today Leo, it is that I want to find a deal. I want to get a deal. Like you, I’ve looked carefully at no deal. I have assessed its consequences, both for our country and yours. And, yes, of course, we could do it, the UK could certainly get through it. But be in no doubt that it would be a failure of statecraft for which we would all be responsible and so, for the sake of business, and farmers, and for millions of ordinary people who are now counting on us to use our imagination and creativity to get this done, I would overwhelmingly prefer to find an agreement.

Our governments have spent three years masticating this problem. I think it is time to honour the achievements of our predecessors who tackled far worse problems by cracking this one ourselves. I won’t say that we can do it all today, but I believe there is a deal to be done by Oct 18. Let’s do it together."
PRE-COVID,PM statement on G7 Summit: 3 September 2019,https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-on-g7-summit-3-september-2019,Prime Minister,3 September 2019,"Mr Speaker, before I begin, I am sure that the whole House will join me in remembering that it is 80 years today that this country entered the Second World War.

And though it is of course true that the horror of that conflict surpasses all modern controversies, it is also true that this country still stands then as now for democracy, for the rule of law, for the fight against racial and religious hatred, and Mr Speaker I know that this House is united in defending those values around the world.

Mr Speaker, with permission I will make a statement about the G7 summit in Biarritz.

As I speak, vast tracts of the Amazon rainforest are on fire, free trade is in retreat,

130 million girls worldwide are not in education, our oceans are being foully polluted,

And so it has never been more important for a Global Britain to use our voice as an agent of change and progress.

It is only by exerting our influence at a global level,

only by sticking up for our values and beliefs, that we can create the international context for Britain to prosper,

and to ensure that this is greatest place on earth to live, to work, to start a family, open a business, trade and invest.

And so, at the G7, I made the case for free trade as an engine of prosperity and progress that has lifted billions out of poverty.

And yet the reality is that trade as a share of the world economy has been stagnant for the last decade.

In the Leaders’ Declaration, the G7 unanimously endorsed “open and fair world trade”; and we’re determined to reform the World Trade Organisation and reach agreement next year to “simplify regulatory barriers”.

Britain is on the verge Mr Speaker, of taking back control of our trade policy and restoring our independent seat in the WTO for the first time in 46 years.

And we could achieve even more in our trade with the United States by using the powers we will regain to do a comprehensive free trade deal, a deal in which President Trump and I have both agreed that the NHS is not on the table.

[Political content removed]

Mr Speaker, I know that the whole House will share my concern about the gravity of the situation in Hong Kong.

As a nation with a deep belief in freedom of expression and assembly, we stand firm in upholding Hong Kong’s way of life, guaranteed by one country, two systems.

And I welcome the unwavering support of my G7 counterparts on this vital matter.

Mr Speaker the UK is at the forefront of a new campaign to end the tragic loss of species around the world.

We cannot bequeath a planet where the Sumatran Tiger and the African Elephant and entire ecosystems like the Great Barrier Reef live in the shadow of destruction.

So I am delighted that the G7 accepted UK proposals for more ambitious targets to halt and reverse the loss of biodiversity.

Britain is responsible for 2.6 million square miles of ocean – the fifth largest maritime estate in the world.

Our Blue Belt programme will ensure that marine protected areas encompass 1.5 million square miles and, at the G7, I announced a further £7 million for this vital effort.

I also announced another £10 million to protect the rainforest in Brazil, where 41,000 fires have raged so far this year, more than twice as many as in the same period in 2018.

Britain is bidding to host the UN’s 26th Climate Change Conference next year. If we succeed, we shall focus on solutions that harness the power of nature, including reforestation.

[Political content removed]

There is one measure that would address all those issues and that is ensuring that every girl in the world receives the education that is her right.

This would not only curb infant mortality, eradicate illiteracy and reduce population pressures, it would strike a blow for morality and justice.

In Biarritz, the G7 therefore endorsed the UK’s campaign for 12 years of quality education for every girl in the world.

And I announced new funding of £90 million so that 600,000 children in countries torn by conflict – where girls are twice as likely as boys to be out of the classroom – get the chance to go to school.

And as well as my G7 colleagues, I was delighted to meet other leaders, including President Ramaphosa of South Africa, Prime Minister Modi of India,

And Prime Minister Morrison of Australia who heroically masked his emotions in the face of the historic innings of Ben Stokes.

In every conversation, I was struck by the enthusiasm of my colleagues to strengthen their relations with this country, whether on trade, security and defence, science and technology.

Mr Speaker, I was also able to use the G7 to follow up my conversations in Berlin and Paris with Chancellor Merkel and President Macron on Brexit, as well with Prime Minister Conte, Prime Minister Sanchez, and President Tusk. I have since spoken to Commission President Juncker, and many other leaders.

And I was able to make clear to them all that everyone in this government wants a deal. But it is a reality that the House of Commons has rejected the current Withdrawal Agreement three times and it simply cannot be resurrected.

That is why I wrote to President Tusk on the 19th August to set out our arguments why any future Agreement must include the abolition of the anti-democratic backstop.

We have also been clear that we will need changes to the Political Declaration, to clarify that our future relationship with the EU will be based on a Free Trade Agreement, and giving us full control over our regulations, our trade, and our foreign and defence policy.

This clarity has brought benefits. Far from jeopardising negotiations, it is making them more straightforward.

In the last few weeks, I believe the chances of a deal have risen. This week we are intensifying the pace of meetings in Brussels. Our European friends can see that we want an agreement. And they are beginning to reflect that reality in their response.

President Macron said if, I quote, Mr. Speaker, they don’t want to hear the words of our counterparts across the Channel, they don’t want to hear about any progress that we might be making, they don’t.

Mr Speaker, I think they are wilfully closing their ears to the reality that our friends and partners are increasingly seeing the possibilities of an agreement and again I quote President Macron of France: “If there are things which, as part of what was negotiated by Michel Barnier, can be adapted and are in keeping with the two objectives I’ve just mentioned – stability in Ireland which we all support and the integrity of the single market – we should identify them in the coming months.”

[Political content removed]

And speaking in Berlin of possible alternatives to the backstop, Chancellor Merkel of Germany said: “Once we see and say this could be a possible outcome, this could be a possible arrangement, this backstop is a sort of placeholder which is no longer necessary”, she said. [Political content removed].

I believe there are indeed solutions.

[Political content removed]

There are practical arrangements that we can find which avoid anyone putting infrastructure on the Irish border. These have been well worked out and involve measures such as trusted trader schemes, transit provisions, frontier zones, reduced bureaucracy for small and local traders, and many others.

In particular, we recognise and I advise the Members opposite to pay attention to what is being said. We recognise that for reasons of geography and economics, agrifood is increasingly managed on a common basis across the island of Ireland. We are ready to find ways forward that recognise this reality, provided it clearly enjoys the consent of all parties and institutions with an interest.

We will also be discussing all this with the EU shortly and I will be discussing it with the Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, when I see him in Dublin on Monday.

Mr Speaker, it is simply wrong to say we are not making progress. There is a lot to do in the coming days. But things are moving.

A major reason for that is that everyone can see this government is utterly determined to leave the EU on 31 October, come what may, without a deal if necessary.

And that is why over the summer my RH Friend the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster has been leading the government’s efforts, seven days a week, to accelerate our national preparations for this possibility. And he will be making a statement on that subject shortly.

My RH Friend the Chancellor has made all the necessary funds available. We have already reached agreements with our partners to roll over trade deals worth around £89 billion of exports and imports. We have secured air services agreements around the world.

We have increased the capacity of our Border Force, strengthened the resilience of our ports, bolstered our freight capacity, and worked with meticulous detail to ensure the uninterrupted supply of critical goods, including medicines. We will be ready, Mr Speaker.

Mr Speaker, I returned from the G7 with real momentum in the Brexit discussions.

Mr Speaker, I want to return from next month’s European Council in a similar way, with a deal that this House can debate and scrutinise and endorse in time for our departure on October 31st.

But Mr Speaker, there is one step that would jeopardise all the progress that we have made at the G7 and around the capitals of Europe.

And that is if this House were to decide that it was simply impossible for us to leave without a deal. And to make that step illegal. That’s what they want, to force us to beg for yet another pointless delay. If that happens, all the progress that we have been making will have been for nothing.

Yesterday Mr Speaker, a Bill was published – a Bill that the leader of the Opposition has spent all summer working on.

This is not a Bill in any normal sense of the word. It is without precedent in our history – it is a Bill that, if passed, would force me to go to Brussels and beg an extension. It would force me to accept any terms offered. It would destroy any chance of negotiations or a new deal. And indeed it would enable our friends in Brussels to dictate the terms of the negotiation, that is what it does.

[Political content removed]

It means running up the white flag.

I want to make clear to everybody in this House – there are no circumstances in which I will ever accept anything like it.

[Political content removed]

Mr Speaker, we promised the people we would get Brexit done. We promised to respect the result of the referendum and we must do so now.

Enough is enough. This country wants this done. They want the referendum respected. We are negotiating a deal and though I am confident of getting a deal we will leave on 31 October in all circumstances. There will be no further pointless delay.

This House has never before voted to force the Prime Minister to surrender such a crucial decision to the discretion of our friends and neighbours overseas.

What is this bill would mean is that unless we agree to the terms of our friends and partners they would be able to keep us in the EU for as long as they want and on their terms.

I urge therefore this House to reject this Bill tonight so that we can get the right deal for our country, deliver Brexit and take the whole country forward.

And I commend this statement to the House.

PRE-COVID,Prime Minister's statement: 2 September 2019,https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-2-september-2019,Prime Minister,2 September 2019,"Five weeks ago I spoke to you from these steps and said that this Government was not going to hang around and that we would not wait until brexit day - October 31 - to deliver on the priorities of the British people.

And so I am proud to say that on Wednesday Chancellor Sajid Javid is going to set out the most ambitious spending round for more than a decade.

I said I wanted to make your streets safer - and that is why we are recruiting another 20,000 police officers.

I said I wanted to improve your hospital and reduce the waiting times at your GP.

And so we are doing 20 new hospital upgrades in addition to the extra £34 billion going into the NHS.

And I said I wanted every child in this country to have a superb education and that’s why I announced last week that we are levelling up funding across the country and spending much more next year in both primary and secondary schools.

And it is to push forward this agenda on these and many other fronts that we need a Queen’s speech in October.

While leaving due time to debate brexit and other matters.

And as we come to that brexit deadline I am encouraged by the progress we are making.

In the last few weeks the chances of a deal have been rising, I believe, for three reasons.

They can see that we want a deal.

They can see that we have a clear vision for our future relationship with the EU - something that has perhaps not always been the case.

And they can see that we are utterly determined to strengthen our position by getting ready to come out regardless, come what may

But if there is one thing that can hold us back in these talks it is the sense in Brussels that MPs may find some way to cancel the referendum

[Political content removed]

I don’t think they will. I hope that they won’t

But if they do they will plainly chop the legs out from under the UK position and make any further negotiation absolutely impossible

[Political content removed]

I want everybody to know – there are no circumstances in which I will ask Brussels to delay. We are leaving on 31 October, no ifs or buts.

We will not accept any attempt to go back on our promises or scrub that referendum

Armed and fortified with that conviction I believe we will get a deal at that crucial summit in October

A deal that parliament will certainly be able to scrutinise

And in the meantime let our negotiators get on with their work

Without that sword of Damocles over their necks

And without an election, which I don’t want and you don’t want

Let us get on with the people’s agenda - fighting crime, improving the NHS, boosting schools, cutting the cost of living, and unlocking talent and opportunity across the entire United Kingdom

With infrastructure education and technology

It is a massive agenda. Let’s come together and get it done - and let’s get Brexit done by October 31.

PRE-COVID,PM statement at G7: 26 August 2019,https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-at-g7-26-august-2019,Prime Minister,26 August 2019,"I’d like to thank President Macron for an incredibly stylish and highly effective Summit that he’s just hosted for us here in Biarritz.

Every conversation that I’ve had with my fellow leaders, I’ve been struck by their enthusiasm to expand and strengthen their relations with our country – whether that’s on trade or security or defence, science and indeed the growing opportunities we’ve had to collaborate in space and technology.

We’ve also spoken in Biarritz about the biggest global challenges confronting us all today and these are things that I think very much matter to the people in the UK.

We’ve been talking about biodiversity. We’ve got to stop the tragic loss of habitats and species that is happening around the world. We can’t just sit back as animals and plants are wiped off the face of the planet.

The world’s animal populations have declined by about 60% in the last fifty years – about a million species are now facing extinction.

And we’ve seen in the Amazon rainforest the tragic increase in fires which are made more likely by deforestation. And that’s why today I’ve announce £10 million in new funding to protect and restore the rainforest in Brazil.

With one million birds and 100,000 mammals losing their lives every year from eating or getting tangled in ocean plastic – we’ve got to do much more to protect the oceans, and today I’ve announced £7 million for the Blue Belt programme to extend our work to protect the vital marine ecosystems in conservation areas in overseas territories.

And don’t forget Britain has the fifth biggest marine estate in the world.

If we don’t act now our children and our grandchildren will never know a world with the Great Barrier Reef, or the Sumatran Tiger or the Black Rhino.

And so next year at the biodiversity COP – the Summit in China – the so called aichi targets must, in our view, be replaced with new, more ambitious targets to help us get back the biodiversity that this planet is losing, and has lost.

And I’m pleased that the G7 Summit today in Biarritz has accepted those UK ideas, those proposals for biodiversity targets, for humanity to set targets to stop the reduction of habitats and species. And obviously we are going to follow up on that at the COP Summit in the UK if we’re lucky enough to get that and I very much believe that we will.

There’s one issue underpinning all that which I believe holds the key to tackling so many global problems and that is the vital importance of educating girls and I’m very pleased that here at the G7 people, everybody, every delegation has supported the UK’s campaign to give every girl in the world 12 years of quality education.

Today I announced funding to give 600,000 children in the world’s most dangerous countries, where girls are twice as likely as boys to be out of school, the opportunity to go to school for the first time.

We discussed Iran, and we are all agreed that Iran should never under any circumstances be allowed to get a nuclear weapon. And there is clearly an opportunity for Iran to now come back into compliance with a nuclear deal – the JCPOA – and to resume dialogue as well as to cease its disruptive behaviour in the region.

We expressed, collectively, deep concern about what is happening in Hong Kong, and the G7 nations all want to support a stable and a prosperous Hong Kong. And we remain collectively committed to the one country two systems framework.

And I was pleased that was reflected in the conclusions of the Summit, which was as I say very productive indeed.

People can quarrel with Summits and with world leaders coming together in this way for discussions about the wide ranging issues we have had – but I really think that if the leaders who have been gathered together in Biarritz over the last couple of days really follow through on these discussions, and really mean what they say in the conclusions, I think it will make a real difference to the issues that the people in our country care very deeply about.

So I thank you very much for sticking with it. I know it’s been a long old Summit, but I’d like to take your questions now."

Trump and Prime Minister Boris Johnson met in the margins of the G7 Summit in Biarritz, France. They celebrated the enduring Special Relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom and reaffirmed the value of the transatlantic partnership.

The President and the Prime Minister noted the unique depth of the security and defense partnership between the two countries and the benefits it brings to each. They committed to increasing the cooperation between the two sovereign nations. President Trump and Prime Minister Johnson also discussed how the United Kingdom leaving the European Union presents many opportunities for deepening our already robust economic and commercial relationship, including a comprehensive trade agreement.

The leaders acknowledged the importance of free, fair, and reciprocal trade and discussed opportunities for deepening our trading relationship in the future based on mutual respect for these principles. The President and Prime Minister also discussed the important role of investment in our respective economies and noted American investment in the United Kingdom is responsible for more than 1 million British jobs and British investment in the United States is responsible for more than 1 million American jobs.

President Trump and Prime Minister Johnson directed United States Director of the National Economic Council Larry Kudlow and United Kingdom Cabinet Secretary Mark Sedwill to launch a “Special Relationship Economic Working Group” (SREWG). The SREWG will develop market-oriented principles for economic growth and increase bilateral cooperation on issues related to the modern 21st century economy."
PRE-COVID,PM’s message to G7 leaders,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pms-message-to-g7-leaders,Prime Minister,24 August 2019,"We are meeting in Biarritz at a critical moment for the world and for Britain. We face unprecedented global challenges at the very time when public trust in the institutions designed to address them risks being undermined.

International tensions and new trade barriers are threatening global growth. Violence and conflict are trapping countries in poverty, depriving children, and particularly girls, of the universal right to education. Climate change is accelerating the devastating and unprecedented loss of habitats and species. My message to G7 leaders this week is this: the Britain I lead will be an international, outward-looking, self-confident nation.

We will be an energetic partner on the world stage. We will stand alongside our G7 allies to solve the most pressing international issues. As a family of nation-states we must reaffirm our core beliefs. Universal values, underpinned by democracy, serve to deliver global prosperity.

Britain will never flinch from the special responsibilities that go with being a pillar and an architect of the international system. Some people question the democratic decision this country has made, fearing that we will retreat from the world. Some think Britain’s best days are behind us. To those people I say: you are gravely mistaken.

We will stand up for liberty, democracy, the rule of law, equality and human rights – the ideals that we share with our friends and allies.

We will remain at the heart of the alliances that span the world. And we will continue to use the breadth of our expertise in diplomacy, defence and development to uphold and safeguard the global order on which peace and prosperity depends."
PRE-COVID,£100 million crackdown on crime in prison,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/100-million-crackdown-on-crime-in-prison,Downing Street,13 August 2019,"Prison security will be boosted by a £100 million investment as part of a crackdown on crime behind bars, the government announced today (13 August 2019).

The investment will target all types of crime in prison; from drug smugglers fuelling a rise in violence and self-harm, to gang kingpins continuing to run their operations from jail, to offenders seeking to contact their victims in the outside world.

Tough airport-style security, including X-ray scanners and metal detectors, will be put into prisons across the estate to clamp down on the drugs, weapons and mobile phones that increase the risk to our officers and hinder rehabilitation.  

Cutting-edge technology to detect and block mobile phones will be brought in to better identify and stop those who seek to organise drug supply or harass victims from the prison wings.

The new funding will bolster efforts to tackle corruption, improving intelligence analysis and strengthening the Counter Corruption Unit that roots out the small minority of dishonest staff and the criminals who seek to manipulate them.

In combination with the 4,700 additional officers who have been recruited since late 2016, this investment can have a major impact on crime behind bars. Without phones and access to drugs, criminal networks will be severely hindered, prison officers will be protected, and ultimately the public will be safer. 

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said:

We cannot allow our prisons to become factories for making bad people worse.

We will stop the drugs, weapons and the mobile phones coming in, so we can safeguard victims, protect staff, cut violence and make our prisons properly equipped to reform and rehabilitate.

The public must see justice being done, punishment being served and feel protected.

Secretary of State for Justice, Robert Buckland QC MP said:

There is a direct link between crime on the wings and crime on our streets - it can no longer be assumed that prison walls are enough to stop organised criminals from continuing their operations.

This funding will have a transformative effect on prisons and give our hard-working officers the advantage as they tackle this scourge head-on.

By disrupting those who continue to offend behind bars, we can keep our staff and other prisoners safe, and make sure that prisons truly fulfil their purpose of protecting the public.

All prisons across the estate will benefit from the measures, with airport-style security being concentrated in the closed estate.

The new security funding comes days after the Prime Minister announced a programme of up to £2.5 billion to create 10,000 additional prison places.

The £100 million is the latest in a series of significant investments to increase security and stability in prisons, including £70 million announced previously. The £70 million funded new security measures such as improved search teams, a digital categorisation tool to better manage offenders’ risk, and improvements to the physical security and safety of the prison estate. Further funding has been made in previous years to build intelligence capabilities, a Financial Investigations Unit and a Serious and Organised Crime Task Force.

This has come against a backdrop of rising prison officer numbers, with more than 4,700 now recruited since October 2016 and staffing levels at their highest since 2012.

The Prime Minister will also confirm a £1 billion boost to NHS capital spending, allowing existing upgrade programmes to proceed and tackling the most urgent infrastructure projects.

Later this week, the Health Secretary will also set out further changes to the NHS pension scheme to support senior doctors and GPs taking on extra shifts.

The NHS is always there for us – free at the point of use for everyone in the country.

With our doctors and nurses working tirelessly day in day out, this treasured institution truly showcases the very best of Britain.

That’s why I made it my immediate task to make sure frontline services have the funding they need, to make a real difference to the lives of NHS staff, and above all, of patients.

Today I’m delivering on this promise with a £1.8 billion cash injection – meaning more beds, new wards, and extra life-saving equipment to ensure patients continue to receive world-class care.

It’s time to face up to this challenge and make sure the NHS receives the funds it needs, to continue being the best healthcare service in the world.

Today’s announcement delivers on the Prime Minister’s pledge when entering Downing Street to urgently upgrade 20 hospitals, and ensure money invested in the NHS is reaching the frontline as soon as possible.

On the visit later today, Boris Johnson is expected to speak to doctors, nurses and other frontline staff to hear directly their thoughts on where the NHS could be better supported.

The £1.8 billion funding is in addition to the extra £33.9 billion, in cash terms, the NHS is set to receive every year by 2023/24 through the Long Term Plan agreed last year. Over £1 billion of this will be spent this year, meaning an annual increase in the NHS’s capital budget of 30%.

The devolved administrations will receive additional Barnett funding in the normal way; indicative allocations are around £110 million for Wales, £180 million for Scotland and £60 million for Northern Ireland.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid said:

Thanks to the hard work of the British people, and the fundamental strength of our economy, we’re in a position to further increase funding for our NHS, ensuring quick access to quality healthcare for those who need it.

This £1.8 billion for frontline services will not just go towards better equipment and technology, but important upgrades of hospitals across the country.

Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock said:

I love the NHS - and so do the millions of taxpayers and their families cared for by our NHS every month. We owe it to them to make sure they can get the best treatment in the best hospitals.

On top of the extra £33.9 billion a year we are giving the NHS, today we are making a downpayment for the future of NHS buildings and facilities, with a £1.8 billion fund to revitalise our hospitals and immediate funding for bigger wards, better mental health units, and state of the art children’s hospitals in areas that need them the most.

This is just the start of our Health Infrastructure Plan, with patients set to see and feel the benefits for years to come.

Chief Executive of NHS England Simon Stevens said:

This is a significant start to the much needed capital investment so that our nurses, doctors and other NHS staff will be able to care for their patients in modern facilities with state of the art equipment.

The concrete steps being set out this week will mean investment flows directly to frontline services, providing new clinics and wards. As they come on line, as part of our NHS Long Term Plan, patients will benefit from reduced waits for treatment and wider upgrades to the quality of care the health service is able to offer.

The 20 hospitals set to be upgraded, at a cost of £850 million, include:

PRE-COVID,PM speech at Manchester Science and Industry Museum,https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-speech-at-manchester-science-and-industry-museum,Prime Minister,27 July 2019,"Good morning everyone and thank you for joining me here in Manchester – in the heart of the world’s first industrial city.

A city whose confidence and whose extraordinary future we can see in the changing fabric of the urban landscape, the mighty towers of Deansgate Square, last week’s extraordinary International Festival in Manchester.

We can see it in the Christie, the hospital where the future of cancer treatment will be written at the vast new Paterson building, with new therapies saving the lives of people around the world for generations to come.

This is not and has never been a city for negativity or navel-gazing.

Indeed when the University of Manchester’s Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov said they were planning to extract a single-atom-thick crystallites from bulk graphite - I hope I’ve got that right - to give us the super-light super-strong wonder that is Graphene…

I imagine that there were people who had no idea what difference it could make to their lives - and frankly people in this audience who have no idea,

Yet today, we stand on the cusp of the Graphene age, with applications in everything from de-icing of aircraft wings to life-saving medicine.

Their story of those pioneers is told here at the Science and Industry Museum, and it is one of the countless tales of Mancunian pioneers.

Because time and again, when the cynics say something cannot be done - Mancunians find a way to get on and do it.

And the centre of Manchester – like the centre of London – is a wonder of the world.

But just a few miles away from here the story is very different.

Towns with famous names, proud histories, fine civic buildings where unfortunately the stereotypical story of the last few decades has been long term decline.

Endemic health problems. Generational unemployment. Down-at-heel high streets.

The story has been, for young people growing up there of hopelessness, or the hope that one day they’ll get out and never come back.

And in so far as that story is true and sometimes it is, the crucial point is it isn’t really the fault of the places and it certainly isn’t the fault of the people growing up there - they haven’t failed.

No, it is we, us the politicians, the politics, that has failed.

Time and again they have voted for change, but for too long politicians have failed to deliver on what is needed.

Our plan now, this new Government I am leading, is to unite our country and level up.

And I want to explain now what I mean by that.

Now I am absolutely not here to tell you, Mr Mayor, that London has all the answers.

Or that everywhere should be like London, or indeed like Manchester.

Each place in our country has a unique heritage, a unique character, and a unique future.

And indeed I recognise that when the British people voted to leave the European Union, they were not just voting against Brussels – they were voting against London too, and against all concentrations of power in remote centres.

So I’m not here to say that Manchester or London are the template for other places.

But I do believe there are lessons to be learnt from the success of cities like these.

I remember London in the 1970s - how it was stuck in post-war gloom and doom.

Between 1951 and 1981 the population actually declined - it went down 20 per cent it was so miserable.

Yet, over the last twenty years, the capital of our country has been utterly transformed.

London is today one of the world’s leading global cities (second only to Manchester!) - with the largest concentration of tech companies, artists, financial services, top class restaurants and all the rest of it.

We can see the same thing happening now in this incredible city.

So today I want to set out what I think are the basic ingredients of success for the UK, and for the places we call home: our cities or our towns, our coastal communities and rural areas.

There are four things I think we need to get right.

First is basic liveability. The streets need to be safe. There need to be enough affordable homes. There need to be jobs that pay good wages. There need to be great public services supporting families and helping the most vulnerable.

Second thing - connections. That means great broadband everywhere, and it means transport. Inspiration and innovation, cross fertilisation between people, literally and figuratively, cannot take place unless people can bump into each other, compete collaborate invent and innovate.

We need to literally and spiritually unite Britain, and that means boosting growth and bringing our regions together.

The third thing that places need is culture. People love Manchester because of the fantastic arts and entertainment here, the football and music, the heritage and the creative industries that make it such a lively, wonderful place to live and work.

We need to help places everywhere to strengthen their cultural and creative infrastructure, the gathering places that give a community its life.

And finally, the fourth thing - places need power and a sense of responsibility, accountability.

Taking back control doesn’t just apply to Westminster regaining sovereignty from the EU. It means our cities and counties and towns becoming more self-governing.

It means people taking more responsibility for their own communities. London and Manchester have boomed partly because they have had Mayors – some better than others, I would say, but all with the power to speak for their cities, to bang heads together, to get things done.

These are the lessons from London and Manchester. Liveability. Connectivity. Culture. And power.

And the first condition of liveability is of course making our streets safer.

Because recorded crime here in the North West is up 42 per cent. I think it’s time we got that down, and we will.

Yesterday I met twenty new officers in Birmingham who are graduating after 15 weeks training. They will now join our brave and formidable police men and women who will be putting their lives on the line for our safety.

But you want more of these policemen and women on our streets – and so do I.

That is why I have committed to an extra 20,000 police officers over the next three years.

Their recruitment will begin in earnest within weeks.

And a new national policing board chaired by our dynamic new Home Secretary will hold the police to account for meeting this target.

We will also give the police greater ability to use stop and search in order to drive a reduction in the violent crime that plagues our communities.

But there is no point in arresting, charging and convicting criminals if we do not then give them the sentences they deserve.

In fact the number of offenders with more than 50 previous convictions who were convicted but spared jail rose from 1,299 in 2007 to 3,196 in 2018.

So we need to restore the public’s faith in our criminal justice system, by ensuring that people who repeatedly commit crimes are punished properly,

and that means those that are guilty of the most serious violent and sexual offences are required to serve a custodial sentence that reflects the severity of their offence.

And it is only by making the streets safer than you can create the neighbourhoods that people want to live.

One of the biggest divides in our country is between those who can afford their own home and those who cannot.

This is a long-term problem which all governments have failed to fix.

So we will review everything - including planning regulations, stamp duty, housing zones, as well as the efficacy of existing Government initiatives.

And, we will also emphasise the need, the duty, to build beautiful homes that people actually want to live in, and being sensitive to local concerns.

And then of course to get great, great neighbourhoods, safe streets, allow people to own their own homes - we need great public services to make that possible.

Which is why I have committed to delivering the funding promised to the NHS by the previous government in June 2018 and to ensure this vital money goes to frontline services as soon as possible.

This will include urgent funding for 20 hospital upgrades and winter readiness.

And proposals drastically to reduce waiting times for GP appointments.

The NHS represents a sacred promise between the state and its citizens. A promise that says we will protect and support one another when we are at our most vulnerable and weakest.

And the same should go for the other great service of wellbeing; particularly social care.

Yet many people who have worked hard all their lives have had to struggle with the financial burden of care in their final years and been forced to sell their homes.

The British people cannot understand why the health service is able to provide the same care for everyone, regardless of income,

And yet the social care system cripples those with savings.

For too long, I think politicians have simply kicked this can down the road. I want you to know, that can-kicking stops now.

So I have promised to find a long term solution to social care once and for all.

And that is what we will do - with a clear plan that will give every older person the dignity and security they deserve.

At the same time, we will give every child the world class education they deserve.

Which is why we will increase the minimum level of per pupil funding in primary and secondary schools and return education funding to previous levels by the end of this parliament.

And we cannot afford any longer the chronic under-funding of our brilliant FE colleges, which do so much to support young people’s skills and our economy.

We have a world class university sector; in fact it is one of the biggest concentrations of higher education anywhere in Europe right here in this city - why should we not aspire to the same status for our further education institutions, to allow people to express their talents?

If you’re going to allow people to express their talents properly, then you need proper connectivity. It is absolutely crucial.

Because if you are someone with a bright idea, or you are running a fantastic business, but you can’t get the connectivity you need and instead spend an eternity staring at that pizza wheel circle of doom on your computer screen – then you won’t be able to get your idea off the ground, you won’t be able to grow your business, and you won’t be able to find customers.

And you can have all the talent in the world

but if you are a young kid in a deprived town, with intermittent transport, and you can’t get to the places where the jobs are then you won’t have the opportunities you deserve.

But people are able to meet each other, and compete with each other, challenge each other, spark off each other - around the water cooler or elsewhere -

That’s when we get the explosion, or flash of creativity and innovation.

That is what we are going to make that happen - not just here but across the country.

First we’re going to invest in fibre roll-out and indeed we have just completed the build of a large fibre cable between Manchester and York alongside the Trans-Pennine railway route.

This interconnects the Manchester and Leeds Internet Exchanges and strengthens the internet infrastructure for the Northern Powerhouse.

I am delighted to see Jake Berry, sitting in the Cabinet, expressing this Government’s commitment to the Northern Powerhouse.

And just now, before coming here, I met Barry White - at the Pomona site - part of a huge stretch of new tramline that will link up to Northern Powerhouse Rail.

I want to be the Prime Minister who does with Northern Powerhouse Rail what we did for Crossrail in London.

And today I am going to deliver on my commitment to that vision with a pledge to fund the Leeds to Manchester route.

I want to stress it will be up to local people to decide what comes next, as far as I’m concerned that’s just the beginning of our commitment and our investment. We want to see this whole thing run.

I have tasked officials to accelerate their work on these plans so that we are ready to do a deal in the autumn.

It is the right thing to do, it’s time we put some substance into the idea of the Northern Powerhouse Rail, and that’s why we are here this morning.

We want to inject some pace into this so that we can unlock jobs and boost growth.

But I know people can’t wait and they want to see change faster. They want change now. It takes a while to build a railway, believe me.

They want reliable, everyday services – so that the 18-year-old in Rochdale just starting out as an apprentice knows that they can get into Manchester for 8 o’clock each morning.

So that people can get out and about in the evening, for a drink and a meal – boosting local businesses and growth.

Services within cities, not just between cities. Services that mean people don’t have to drive. Services that don’t just give up at the end of the working day.

So I am going to improve - with your help - the local services which people use every day. And I want that to start now with improvements that can happen in the short term.

That means buses. I know a lot about buses, believe me. I love buses. I helped to invent a new type of bus, very beautiful that it is.

I will begin as a matter of urgency the transformation of local bus services – starting here today in Manchester.

I will work with the Mayor of Greater Manchester on his plans to deliver a London style bus system in the area under powers we gave to him - you Andy - in the Bus Services Act.

I want higher frequency, low-emission or zero-emission buses, more bus priority corridors, a network that’s easier to understand and use.

I want local partnerships between the private sector, which operates the buses, and a public body, which coordinates them.

In London – where they have all these things – bus passenger journeys have risen by 97 per cent in 25 years.

In other metropolitan areas – where they do not – it has fallen by 34 per cent over the same period.

I think we can see the first results, here in Greater Manchester, within a few months.

And I want the same for any other part of the country where local leaders want to do it.

Good bus connections, good transport connectivity, is also vital to so many of the towns that feel left behind.

We are also going to start answering the pleas of some of our left behind towns,

And this might come as a surprise to some, but not everyone wants to live in one of our country’s great cities.

Too many places - towns and coastal communities - that don’t feel they are getting benefits from the grown we are seeing elsewhere in the UK economy.

Now I reject the ridiculous idea that everybody’s ambition is to get on their bikes and move to the city.

Our post-industrial towns have a proud, great heritage - but an even greater future. Their best years lie ahead of them.

So we are going to put proper money into the places that need it.

We will start by ensuring there is investment from central government – by bringing forward plans on the UK Shared Prosperity Fund - and we have growth deals as well for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

And we’re now going to have a £3.6 billion Towns Fund supporting an initial 100 towns. So that they will get the improved transport and improved broadband connectivity that they need.

They’ll also get help with that vital social and cultural infrastructure, from libraries and art centres to parks and youth services: the institutions that bring communities together, and give places new energy and new life.

Finally, of course, there is an even more radical shift that we need to make now to deliver this and I have seen myself the changes that you can bring about in towns and cities and regions, when local people have more of a say over their own destinies. A say over their own destinies.

And I do not believe that, when the people of the United Kingdom voted to take back control, they did so in order for that control to be hoarded in Westminster.

So we are going to give greater powers to council leaders and to communities.

We are going to level up the powers offered to mayors so that more people can benefit from the kind of local government structures seen in London and here in Manchester.

We are going to give more communities a greater say over changes to transport, housing, public services and infrastructure that will benefit their areas and drive local growth.

And in doing so, we will see to it that every part of this country sees the benefits of the potentially massive opportunity that will come from Brexit.

Over the last three years, we have tended to treat Brexit like some impending adverse weather event.

I campaigned to leave the EU because I believed it was a chance to change the direction of the UK and make us the best country in the world to live.

Leaving the EU is a massive economic opportunity - to do the things we’ve not been allowed to do for decades, to rid ourselves of bureaucratic red tape, create jobs, untangle the creativity and innovation for which Britain is famous.

And we do not need to wait to start preparing to seize the benefits of that project.

So we will begin right away to create the free ports that will generate thousands of high-skilled jobs - and revitalise some of the poorest parts of our country.

We will begin right away on working to change the tax rules to provide extra incentives to invest in capital and research

We will double down on our investment in R&D, we will accelerate the talks on those free trade deals

And prepare an economic package to boost British business and lengthen this country’s lead as the number one destination in Europe for overseas investment.

At the same time we will unite and level up across our country - as I say, with infrastructure, better education and with technology.

And in so doing, making our whole nation not just an alright kind of place to live, or a better-than-average place to live but the greatest place on earth. The greatest place to live, to raise a family, to send your kids to school, a great place to start a business, to invest and to have a life -

And where better than Manchester, where better than the Science and Industry Museum, to set out our ambition for doing so.

Here today we can look back at centuries of progress, the inventions, ideas and breakthroughs that came out of Manchester, came out of the North, came out of the United Kingdom and shaped the world we know today.

I just want you to imagine, if we were to reconvene here 30, 40, 50 or more years hence, what treasures this museum might hold then.

I’m absolutely certain there will be displays celebrating the dawn of a new age of electric vehicles, not just cars or buses, but electric planes, made possible with battery technology being developed now in the UK.

You will see tributes and dioramas commemorating the men and women who use new gene therapies to cure the incurable and achieve the impossible.

Here in Manchester, home of the world’s first passenger railway, with Stephenson’s rocket behind me, we should remember that there were people back then who thought that the whole project should be abandoned as a danger to public health, because the speeds that were being proposed would be intolerable for the human body.

So I can imagine in the future of this wonderful museum there will exhibits recording not only the breakthroughs in bioscience, here in Manchester and elsewhere that allow the UK to lead the world in producing genetically modified crops - blight-resistance potatoes will feed the world.

But also a memorial to the sceptics and doubters, complete with bioengineered edible paper, with which they were forced to eat their words.

I don’t blame the doubters and the sceptics, but all I will say, is that the evidence is behind us, there’s Stephenson’s rocket behind us, we’re sending rockets into space - we will expand our space programme as well.

I don’t blame the doubters and the sceptics, it’s a natural human instinct, but time and again, they have been proved wrong.

I think they will be proved wrong again.

If we unite our country, with better education, better infrastructure, with an emphasis on new technology, then this really can be a new golden age for the UK.

Time and again Manchester has shown the UK that anything is possible. Time and again this extraordinary country has delivered the same message to the world. That’s what we are going to do once more.

PRE-COVID,PM statement on priorities for the government: 25 July 2019,https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-on-priorities-for-the-government-25-july-2019,Prime Minister,25 July 2019,"Mr Speaker, I with permission, shall make a statement on the mission of this new Conservative Government.

But before I begin, I am sure the whole House will join me in paying tribute to my Rt Hon Friend the Member for Maidenhead - for all that she has given in the service of our nation.

From fighting modern slavery to tackling the problems of mental ill-health – she has a great legacy on which we shall all be proud to build.

And our mission is to deliver Brexit on the 31st of October for the purpose of uniting and re-energising our great United Kingdom and making this country the greatest place on earth.

And when I say the greatest place on earth, I’m conscious that some may accuse me of hyperbole. But it is useful to imagine the trajectory on which we could now be embarked.

By 2050 it is more than possible that the United Kingdom will be the greatest and most prosperous economy in Europe – at the centre of a new network of trade deals that we have pioneered.

With the road and rail investments we are making and propose to make now – the investment in broadband and 5G – our country will boast the most formidable transport and technological connectivity on the planet.

By unleashing the productive power of the whole United Kingdom - not just of London and the South East but of every corner of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland – we will have closed forever the productivity gap and seen to it that no town is left behind ever again; no community ever again forgotten.

Our children and grandchildren will be living longer, happier, healthier, wealthier lives.

Our United Kingdom of 2050 will no longer make any contribution whatsoever to the destruction of our precious planet brought about by carbon emissions – because we will have led the world in delivering that net zero target.

We will be the home of electric vehicles – cars, even planes, powered by British made battery technology being developed right here, right now.

We will have the freeports to revitalise our coastal communities, a bioscience sector liberated from anti genetic modification rules, blight-resistant crops that will feed the world - and the satellite and earth observation systems that are the envy of the world.

We will be the seedbed for the most exciting and most dynamic business investments on the planet.

Our Constitutional settlement, our United Kingdom will be firm, will be secure.

Our Union of nations beyond question.

Our democracy robust.

Our future clean, green, prosperous, united, confident, ambitious – this my friends is the prize, more still the responsibility that it falls on us to fulfil.

And to do so, we must take some immediate steps.

The first is to restore trust in our democracy and fulfil the repeated promises of Parliament to the people by coming out of the European Union – and doing so on October 31st.

I and all ministers in this government are committed to leaving on this date, whatever the circumstances. To do otherwise would cause a catastrophic loss of confidence in our political system. It will leave the British people wondering whether their politicians could ever be trusted again to follow a clear democratic instruction.

I would prefer us to leave the EU with a deal. I would much prefer it. I believe that is still possible even at this late stage and I will work flat out to make it happen. But certain things need to be clear.

The Withdrawal Agreement negotiated by my predecessor has been three times rejected by this House. Its terms are unacceptable to this Parliament and to this country. No country that values its independence and indeed its self-respect could agree to a Treaty which signed away our economic independence and self-government as this backstop does. A time limit is not enough. If an agreement is to be reached it must be clearly understood that the way to the deal goes by way of the abolition of the backstop.

For our part we are ready to negotiate in good faith an alternative, with provisions to ensure that the Irish border issues are dealt with where they should always have been: in the negotiations on the future agreement between the UK and the EU. I do not accept the argument that says that these issues can only be solved by all or part of the UK remaining in the customs union or in the single market. The evidence is that other arrangements are perfectly possible, and are also perfectly compatible with the Belfast or Good Friday Agreement, to which we are of course steadfastly committed.

I, my team, and my Rt Hon Friend the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union are ready to meet and to talk on this basis to the Commission or other EU colleagues whenever they are ready to do so.

For our part, we will throw ourselves into these negotiations with the greatest energy and determination and in the spirit of friendship.

And I hope that the EU will be equally ready and that they will rethink their current refusal to make any changes to the Withdrawal Agreement.

If they do not, we will of course have to leave the EU without an agreement under Article 50. The UK is better prepared for that situation than many believe. But we are not as ready yet as we should be. In the 98 days that remain to us we must turbo-charge our preparations to make sure that there is as little disruption as possible to our national life. I believe that is possible with the kind of national effort that the British people have made before and will make again. In these circumstances we would, of course, also have available the £39bn in the Withdrawal Agreement to help deal with any consequences.

I have today instructed the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to make these preparations his top priority. I have asked the Cabinet Secretary to mobilise the Civil Service to deliver this outcome should it become necessary. And the Chancellor has confirmed that all necessary funding will be made available.

I will also ensure that preparing for leaving the EU without an agreement under Article 50 is not just about seeking to mitigate the challenges but also about grasping the opportunities. This is not just about technical preparations, vital though they are. It is about having a clear economic strategy for the UK in all scenarios, something which the Conservative Party has always led the way, and it’s about producing policies which will boost the competitiveness and the productivity of our economy when we are free of the EU regulations.

Indeed, Mr Speaker, we will begin right away on working to change the tax rules to provide extra incentives to invest in capital and research.

And we will be now accelerating the talks on those free trade deals.

And we will prepare an economic package to boost British business and lengthen this country’s lead as the number one destination in this continent for overseas investment.

A status that is made possible by the diversity talent and skills of our workforce and,

Mr Speaker, I also want therefore to repeat unequivocally our guarantee to the 3.2 million EU nationals now living and working among us. I thank them for their contribution to our society – and for their patience - and I can assure them that under this government they will have the absolute certainty of the right to live and remain.

Mr Speaker, I want to end by making clear that my commitment to the 31 October date for our exit.

Our national participation in the European Union is coming to an end.

This reality needs to be recognised by all parties.

Indeed, Mr Speaker today there are very many brilliant officials trapped in meeting after meeting in Brussels and Luxembourg when they could be better deploying their talents in preparing to pioneer new trade deals and promoting a truly Global Britain.

I want to start unshackling our officials to undertake this new mission right away.

So we will not nominate a UK Commissioner for the new Commission taking office on 1 November – though clearly this is not intended to stop the EU appointing a new commission.

Mr Speaker, today is the first day of a new approach, which will end with our exit from the EU on 31 October. Then I hope we can have a friendly and constructive relationship – as constitutional equals, as friends, and partners in facing the challenges that lie ahead. I believe that is possible and this government will work to make it so.

But Mr Speaker, we are not going to wait until 31st October to begin building the broader and bolder future that I have described.

We are going to start right away, providing vital funding for our frontline public services, to deliver better healthcare, better education and more police on the streets.

Mr Speaker, I am committed to making sure that the NHS receives the funds that were promised by the last government in June 2018 and that these funds go to frontline as soon as possible. This will include urgent funding for 20 hospital upgrades and winter-readiness. I have asked officials to provide policy proposals for drastically reducing waiting times and for GP appointments.

To address the rise of violent crime in our country I have announced that there will be 20,000 extra police keeping us safe over the next three years, and I have asked my Rt Hon Friend the Home Secretary to ensure this is treated as an absolute priority.

We will give greater powers for the police to use stop and search to help tackle violent crime. I have also tasked officials to draw up proposals to ensure that in future those found guilty of the most serious sexual and violent offences are required to serve a custodial sentence that truly reflects the severity of their offence and policy measures that will see a reduction in the number of prolific offenders.

On education, I have listened to the concerns of many colleagues and we will increase the minimum level of per pupil funding in primary and secondary schools and return education funding to previous levels by the end of this Parliament.

We are committed to levelling up across every nation and region across the UK, providing support to towns and cities and closing the opportunity gap in our society.

We will announce investment in vital infrastructure, fibre rollout, transport and housing that can improve people’s quality of life, fuel economic growth and provide opportunity.

Finally, we will also ensure that we continue to attract the brightest and best talent from around the world. No-one believes more strongly than me in the benefits of migration to our country. But I am clear that our immigration system must change. For years, politicians have promised the public an Australian-style points based system.

And today I will actually deliver on those promises - I will ask the Migration Advisory Committee to conduct a review of that system as the first step in a radical rewriting of our immigration system. I am convinced that we can produce a system that the British public can have confidence in.

Mr Speaker, over these past few years, too many people in this country feel that they have been told repeatedly and relentlessly what we cannot do.

Since I was a child I remember respectable authorities asserting that our time as a nation has passed, that we should be content with mediocrity and managed decline.

And time and again – even the sceptics and doubters - by their powers to innovate and adapt the British people have showed the doubters wrong.

And Mr Speaker I believe that at this pivotal moment in our national story we are going to prove the doubters wrong again.

Not just with positive thinking and a can-do attitude, important though they are.

But with the help and the encouragement government and a Cabinet that is bursting with ideas, ready to create change, determined to implement the policies we need to succeed as a nation.

The greatest place to live

The greatest place to bring up a family

The greatest place to send your kids to school

The greatest place to set up a business or to invest

Because we have the best transport and the cleanest environment and the best healthcare,

And the most compassionate approach to care of elderly people.

That is the mission of the Cabinet I have appointed.

That is the purpose of the government I am leading.

And that is why I believe that if we bend our sinews to the task now,

There is every chance that in 2050,

When I fully intend to be around, though not necessarily in this job we will look back on this period, this extraordinary period, as the beginning of a new golden age for our United Kingdom.

And I commend this future to the House just as much as I commend this statement."
PRE-COVID,Boris Johnson's first speech as Prime Minister: 24 July 2019,https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/boris-johnsons-first-speech-as-prime-minister-24-july-2019,Prime Minister,24 July 2019,"Good afternoon

I have just been to see Her Majesty the Queen who has invited me to form a government and I have accepted

I pay tribute to the fortitude and patience of my predecessor

and her deep sense of public service

but in spite of all her efforts it has become clear that there are pessimists at home and abroad

who think that after three years of indecision

that this country has become a prisoner to the old arguments of 2016

and that in this home of democracy we are incapable of honouring a basic democratic mandate

And so I am standing before you today to tell you

the British people

that those critics are wrong

The doubters, the doomsters, the gloomsters – they are going to get it wrong again

The people who bet against Britain are going to lose their shirts

because we are going to restore trust in our democracy

and we are going to fulfil the repeated promises of parliament to the people and come out of the EU on October 31

no ifs or buts

and we will do a new deal, a better deal that will maximise the opportunities of Brexit while allowing us to develop a new and exciting partnership with the rest of Europe

based on free trade and mutual support

I have every confidence that in 99 days’ time we will have cracked it

but you know what – we aren’t going to wait 99 days

because the British people have had enough of waiting

The time has come to act,

to take decisions

to give strong leadership and to change this country for the better

and though the Queen has just honoured me with this extraordinary office of state

my job is to serve you, the people

because if there is one point we politicians need to remember it is that the people are our bosses

My job is to make your streets safer – and we are going to begin with another 20,000 police on the streets

and we start recruiting forthwith

My job is to make sure you don’t have to wait 3 weeks to see your GP

and we start work this week with 20 new hospital upgrades, and ensuring that money for the NHS really does get to the front line

My job is to protect you or your parents or grandparents from the fear of having to sell your home to pay for the costs of care

and so I am announcing now – on the steps of Downing Street – that we will fix the crisis in social care once and for all with a clear plan we have prepared

to give every older person the dignity and security they deserve

My job is to make sure your kids get a superb education

wherever they are in the country

and that’s why we have already announced that we are going to level up per pupil funding in primary and secondary schools

and that is the work that begins immediately behind that black door

and though I am today building a great team of men and women I will take personal responsibility

for the change I want to see

Never mind the backstop – the buck stops here

And I will tell you something else about my job.

It is to be Prime Minister of the whole United Kingdom

and that means uniting our country

answering at last the plea of the forgotten people

and the left behind towns

by physically and literally renewing the ties that bind us together

so that with safer streets and better education and fantastic new road and rail infrastructure and full fibre broadband

we level up across Britain

with higher wages, and a higher living wage, and higher productivity

we close the opportunity gap

giving millions of young people the chance to own their own homes

and giving business the confidence to invest across the UK

because it is time we unleashed the productive power not just of London and the South East

but of every corner of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland

the awesome foursome that are incarnated in that red white and blue flag

who together are so much more than the sum of their parts

and whose brand and political personality is admired and even loved around the world

for our inventiveness, for our humour, for our universities, our scientists, our armed forces, our diplomacy

for the equalities on which we insist – whether race or gender or LGBT or the right of every girl in the world to 12 years of quality education

and for the values we stand for around the world

Everyone knows the values that flag represents

It stands for freedom and free speech and habeas corpus and the rule of law

and above all it stands for democracy

and that is why we will come out of the EU on October 31

because in the end Brexit was a fundamental decision by the British people that they wanted their laws made by people that they can elect

and they can remove from office

and we must now respect that decision

and create a new partnership with our European friends – as warm and as close and as affectionate as possible

and the first step is to repeat unequivocally our guarantee to the 3.2 m EU nationals now living and working among us

and I say directly to you – thank you for your contribution to our society

thank you for your patience and I can assure you that under this government you will get the absolute certainty of the rights

to live and remain

And next I say to our friends in Ireland, and in Brussels and around the EU

I am convinced that we can do a deal

without checks at the Irish border, because we refuse under any circumstances to have such checks

and yet without that anti-democratic backstop

and it is of course vital at the same time that we prepare for the remote possibility

that Brussels refuses any further to negotiate

and we are forced to come out with no deal

not because we want that outcome – of course not

but because it is only common sense to prepare

and let me stress that there is a vital sense in which those preparations cannot be wasted

and that is because under any circumstances we will need to get ready

at some point in the near future

to come out of the EU customs union and out of regulatory control

fully determined at last to take advantage of brexit

because that is the course on which this country is now set

with high hearts and growing confidence we will now accelerate the work of getting ready

and the ports will be ready and the banks will be ready

and the factories will be ready

and business will be ready

and the hospitals will be ready

and our amazing food and farming sector will be ready and waiting to continue selling

ever more not just here but around the world

and don’t forget that in the event of a no deal outcome we will have the extra lubrication of the £39 bn

and whatever deal we do we will prepare this autumn for an economic package

to boost British business and to lengthen this country’s lead as the number one destination in this continent for overseas investment

and to all those who continue to prophesy disaster

I say yes – there will be difficulties

though I believe that with energy and application they will be far less serious than some have claimed

but if there is one thing that has really sapped the confidence of business over the last three years

it is not the decisions we have taken

it is our refusal to take decisions

and to all those who say we cannot be ready

I say do not underestimate this country

Do not underestimate our powers of organisation and our determination

because we know the enormous strengths of this economy

in life sciences, in tech, in academia, in music, the arts, culture, financial services,

It is here in Britain that we are using gene therapy, for the first time, to treat the most common form of blindness

here in Britain that we are leading the world in the battery technology that will help cut CO2 and tackle climate change

and produce green jobs for the next generation

and as we prepare for a post-Brexit future it is time we looked not at the risks but at the opportunities that are upon us

so let us begin work now to create freeports that will drive growth and thousands of high-skilled jobs in left behind areas

let’s start now to liberate the UK’s extraordinary bioscience sector from anti genetic modification rules

and let’s develop the blight-resistant crops that will feed the world

let’s get going now on our own position navigation and timing satellite and earth observation systems – UK assets orbiting in space with all the long term strategic and commercial benefits for this country

Let’s change the tax rules to provide extra incentives to invest in capital and research

and let’s promote the welfare of animals that has always been so close to the hearts of the British people

and yes, let’s start now on those free trade deals

because it is free trade that has done more than anything else to lift billions out of poverty

all this and more we can do now and only now, at this extraordinary moment in our history

and after three years of unfounded self-doubt it is time to

change the record

to recover our natural and historic role as an enterprising, outward-looking and truly global Britain, generous in temper and engaged with the world

No one in the last few centuries has succeeded in betting against the pluck and nerve and ambition of this country

They will not succeed today

We in this government will work flat out to give this country the leadership it deserves

and that work begins now

Thank you very much"
